<p><strong>June 8</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at my host’s house in Montpellier at 10:30 PM. It seems like a quiet neighborhood with lots of surrounding trees. My host greeted me outside and brought me upstairs. She’s explaining everything in very simple French, and I mostly give one- or two-word answers. It turns out I have a roommate, but he’s spending the weekend in Barcelona and won’t be back until tomorrow night. His name is Josh, and he’s from Australia.</p>

<p><strong>June 9</strong></p>
<p>It’s a holiday, and I don’t have anything to eat, so I found a fast-food shop nearby on the way to the grocery store. When I approached the counter, I led with something like “Excuse my poor French,” in French. The guy looked confused and asked, “English?” and asked another guy in the back to help me. With the new guy, I kept speaking French. “Why the hell did you call me out here for?” he asked the other guy as he helped me with my order.</p>
<p>At the hypermarket, I circled around forever looking for things I needed. As I checked out, I prayed everything would go smoothly. There was a moment where it looked like my credit card wasn’t working, but it did.</p>

<p><strong>June 10</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at school at 8:15 for orientation with 14 other new students and went to a room. A couple of people were chatting in English or another language, but otherwise, we sat in absolute silence. Everyone was nervous and unsure. A teacher came by and handed out our class schedules and welcomed us. We gave introductions (in French or English). At 9:00, everyone was dismissed to go to their first class. I realized on my course sheet that they put me in the class labeled “Advanced.” I thought there was supposed to be an in-person, oral test. They put me in the advanced class just because of an online test I took three months ago? That I may or may not have looked up some of the answers for? I was hoping they’d calibrate me after I got here.</p>
<p>When I entered class, I almost burst out laughing. There are 9 other people in the class, and every single other person appears to be a teenage girl. The teacher asks me to introduce myself. I go through my well-practiced personal intro, and I hope I can fake my way enough through this and through the day before I ask to be moved to another class. And thus followed 4.5 hours of French instruction, from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with two 15-minute breaks.</p>
<p>I headed home early right after class to call it a day. I took a nap.</p>

<p><strong>June 11</strong></p>
<p>It's my second day at school. The dynamic here isn't like normal school; the best way I can describe it is like being in Saturday morning Chinese school when I was in grade school. I can tell no one is close to each other. They must have all registered independently. It's also clear that many don't really try that hard, like they don’t really care to be there. Before class starts, everyone chats in English, but during class, everyone is painfully quiet. I sympathize with the professor who is trying to get the class to participate. Whenever the silence lingers too long, I volunteer and go for it. I don't worry about sounding bad, I think it helps everyone feel more at ease. It’s easier because I’m older, maybe the others feel some peer pressure.</p>
<p>During breaks, all the girls chat to each other in English again as they leave the room. I'm so curious why each person is here. I want to ask everyone what they're doing here.</p>
<p>Today, there's a new person in class, Teo. He's Asian and a guy, so he seems a lot more approachable than anyone else. During our first break, I summoned the courage to talk to him. I asked him what he was doing here in French, and to my surprise, he responded with excellent English. He’s Korean and he's been studying French here for five months already, for a total of ten months. He's 20 years old and wants to go to university in Paris in the future. He was hand-rolling tobacco into a cigarette as we chatted before leaving to smoke it. You can tell he’s the type of person who is cool.</p>
<p>There are two more people who consistently don't leave with the other girls during the break: Victoria and Manami. Victoria is from Russia, and Manami is from Japan. They've both been here a few weeks. Victoria is staying until next week, and Manami until August. Neither of them speak much English, so they are particularly alienated from the rest of the class. They're both here purely for pleasure. I also learned they are surprisingly older, like me, in their 30s. It’s not obvious at all.</p>

<p><strong>June 12</strong></p>
<p>It's become apparant that "Advanced" is an inflated title. The material we're covering is very basic. The teacher explained that the class is for learners who are "approaching" an advanced level, and we're just at the beginning of level B2.</p>
<p>Also it's become clear to me that there’s a lot of variance in ability in my class. There are quite a few who speak very well, naturally and fluidly, and others who struggle to put a sentence together. I sympathize because it’s scary trying to speak a new language. It’s especially hard when you don’t speak English. French and English are so similar that learning it as a native English speaker must be several times easier than with a completely unrelated language. I’d say the ability among the students ranges from A2 to B2,which is very wide, and I’m somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>The school organizes afternoon activities for its students, and I decided to finally participate and meet some other people. We were going to the Banksy exhibition on the outskirts of the city. I met up in front of the school with the others, who, unsurprisingly, were all speaking English, except for one guy speaking French so fluently I assumed he wasn’t part of the school until he started following our group. His name is Jon (pronounced YON), he's Swiss, and in C1, the class above mine. He mentioned he's taking the C1 certification test on Tuesday, so it's no surprise he has such incredible fluency. Jon and I chatted with each other during our commute to the exhibition. His native language is German, but he speaks flawless English, as you would expect from an educated Swiss. He really liked to talk about Swiss politics and what it's like to be Swiss, and I reciprocated as best I could in French. When things got too complicated, he switched to English and continued the conversation from there, and then one of us would switch back to French when we felt like it. While we were on the train, which was packed to the brim, I wondered what a funny sight the two of us must have been.</p>
<p>We ended up grabbing dinner together. When we entered the restaurant, the host said something to us at lightning speed that neither of us understood. "English menus?" the host asked us. We politely declined and told him we were practicing. Even with countless hours of study and an imminent C1 certification, small, simple interactions can sometimes still be hard. And just because the server asks if you need English menus, it doesn't mean you can't continue in French. They're probably just used to people actually being bad at French.</p>

<p><strong>June 13</strong></p>

<p>Josh left this morning. While he was here, he woke up at 6:00 a.m. every morning for work. I could hear him having meetings in his room. He went to another language school, and his class started at 2:00 p.m., so he didn't come home until relatively late. In the brief time we overlapped, he was rarely in the mood to talk when he returned in the evening, but I was able to chat with him briefly. He’s pretty much exactly the same as me: we’re the same age and came to Montpellier to study and immerse ourselves in a language that we picked at random. He’s a consultant at Deloitte and had the flexibility to work and immerse himself at the same time. He’s leaving for Greece just for fun, and then he’s going to a wedding.</p>

<p>Today was the last day of class for two girls, Clara and Riley. I learned separately that Clara was part of a group from an international high school in Cape Town, South Africa; they had many 8th and 9th graders and a single 11th grader. During the class, Clara and I were paired together to do some exercises, so I took the opportunity to ask her a few questions during the break.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><b>Will:</b> You’re with the group from South Africa, right? I met your chaperone yesterday at the Banksy excursion. You must be the 11th grader they mentioned.</p>
	<p><b>Clara:</b> Oh, you think I’m in 11th grade? I’m in eighth grade. I’m 14 years old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out Clara is an absolute infant. Her French is so good because her parents speak French. When she speaks, she has an excellent accent, and I was sure to compliment her on that. While we were speaking, Riley came back from break, and we filled her in. I asked her what she was doing here at language school. Riley is a collegiate athlete on a scholarship, and as a result, she’s not allowed to study abroad if she intends to keep her scholarship. Her university has a program where they come to Accent Français for three weeks at the end of May as a pseudo-abroad program. But she’s the only one in the advanced class; all of the other kids from her school are in classes below. Then she asked me a question.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> Ok I’m been trying to place you but I can’t figure it out…how old are you??</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> Uh sure I can tell you, it’s not a secret…</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> …</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> …</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> So??? Do you want me to guess???</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> No no…I’m 32…</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> WHAT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isabel (high school student from Mexico/North Carolina) comes back from break</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> ISABEL GUESS HOW OLD HE IS</p>
	<p><strong>Isabel:</strong> uhhh i don’t know</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> HE’S 32</p>
	<p><strong>Isabel:</strong> whattt <em>*covers face with hand*</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gwen (college student from New York City) walks in</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> GWEN. GUESS HOW OLD HE IS</p>
	<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> Uh I dunno like 25?</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> HE’S 32</p>
	<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> Yeah that’s not that weird, I guessed mid to late 20s </p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> YOU SAID 25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole time I was feeling very embarrassed. I guess it’s good that people think I look young, but clearly, these girls think 32 is ancient.</p>

<p>The turnout for Pride today in Montpellier is impressive. It has a very young and liberal feel; I see queer folks absolutely everywhere. The slogan that’s everywhere is “MONTPELLIER T’AIME,” which I think is funny because in the Paris airports you see “PARIS VOUS AIME.” Both mean “[city] loves you,” except Paris is formal and Montpellier is informal. I guess Montpellier is making a statement about being chill, or trying to avoid getting sued by Paris.</p>

<p>After walking around forever, I grabbed dinner at YURICHA. I sat outside because that was the only seating available, which was a mistake because the street is extremely narrow and I’m surrounded by smokers, so it’s like eating inside a casino.</p>

<p><strong>June 15</strong></p>

<p>I live with a host family. In this case it’s just one moment, it’s a single 69 retiree woman. Her name is Lydia. The first few days I was nervous to come out of my room to talk to her but it’s better now after a week of getting used to it. It helps that she’s used to hosting students so she has the right expectations, and she doesn’t speak too fast. </p>

<p>Lydia says she mainly hosts students for the money, and it’s clear that money is a constant concern for her. She asks me to unplug all my electronics when I’m out of the house, not to cook too much (since gas is expensive), not to take too long a shower, etc. She lives in government housing which controls her rent, but she used to have her own house seven years ago before finances became too constrained. She’s brought up three separate times how things started getting worse for the French people in 2020, and ever since then prices for everything have been increasing non stop. She says it’s the fault of the French government, and that she’ll never vote for Macron again.</p>

<p>She has two ex husbands, six kids, and even more grandkids. Today she went to a large family gathering with her kids and grandkids and their own families. The gathering was 30 kilometres away, and she hitched a ride with her ex husband. She doesn’t own a car. There were 28 people total. She’s very proud of her family, but she’d been on her feet for too long today so she has difficulty walking. </p>

<p>I appreciate Lydia. She makes an effort to speak with me everyday even when she’s feeling tired or hurt. She likes to complain and she’ll go on long tangents about whatever is bothering her at the moment. I don’t mind it because it gives me a chance to practice listening and communication. All and all, I have a lot of freedom and a good number of chances to speak, but I miss the comfort of home and living alone. I’m looking forward to AC when my stay here is over. </p>

<p><strong>June 16</strong></p>

<p>It’s a new week at school and some people have left and new people have joined. One of them is our first older student. Her name is Nicole, she’s in her 60s, and she’s come to this specific language school other times in the past. I sat next to her so we’re paired up for exercises that day. She has a really strong American accent and whenever she struggles to say something she starts speaking bits of English, like she’s desperate to be understood. It’s really distracting for me and actively detrimental for her. I wonder where this habit comes from, or if it’s a personality trait. When she switches to English to get her point across when she couldn’t in French, is it because it was an important thing for me to know? Or is it important for her to be comprehensible? What does it say about her personality? I’ll never know. </p>

<p>After class I mention very politely (1 on 1, not in front of anyone else except the teacher) her habit of using English and I recommend she try to only use French during the class. She seems like she has a lot of anxiety with speaking and her ability. She asks the teacher if she should drop to the class below, but the teacher says that class might be too basic. Personally I feel like dropping down a level would help with her confidence. Spending class riddled with anxiety can’t be a good situation for learning.</p>

<p>My intensive classes in the afternoon are with a completely different group of people. Last week it was a mix of students and older folks and we worked on random topics. Honestly it doesn’t seem that worth it. Today my intensive class only has three people. With a smaller group it’s really nice to get to ask questions and get a lot of attention. </p>

<p><strong>June 17</strong></p>

<p>After class I got ramen for dinner. There was no one inside when I walked in at 7pm, which is considered early for dinner. I was seated right next to where the cashier/server was stationed. I ordered successfully and after I received my food and we were both alone in the restaurant, I tried to make small talk. I asked him where he was from. Turns out he’s Chinese and he moved to Montpellier in 2004 for university for biology, he worked at a startup for a while and then quit to open a restaurant. He’s the only person working there at the moment. He said in the summer it’s normal for it to be this slow, but during the winter it’s much busier and he has to hire help. I tried to speak some Chinese to him and he did a double take. He thought I was Korean. I said it’s because of the hair.</p>

<p>Two customers came in and sat down and the guy went to serve them. I whispered “merci” and went back to eating. I thought it would be rude to continue to chat with him with other people in the room, but after he served the other group he came back to the station and kept chatting with me. I told him about why I was here and what my plans were. I asked him for restaurant recommendations. I asked him if there were a lot of Chinese people in Montpellier (there are, but in certain districts I guess). He said he knows all the other Chinese restaurant owners in the area, which he says are authentic and good. He said they all have to be a little bit strange to want to open a restaurant. He said go to Marché du Lez and get pigs feet from a stall. He said the best seafood is at this Chinese all you can eat buffet called “Top Grande”. By this point the entire restaurant had filled up, and he juggled taking orders, bringing out food, and going back to chatting with me.</p>

<p>Tonight I joined another after-school activity. Together we went to the café at La Panacée, which is an art museum, not to see art, but for a language exchange that happens every Wednesday. It’s in an open courtyard in the middle of the building, and it’s completely packed. There’s a table specifically for the exchange, called International Chatters, and I make my way over. I meet a few French people, and we take turns speaking French and English. I still feel like my comprehension is holding me back, so it’s hard to keep the conversation going in French because I always look unsure. I’m also endlessly impressed by everyone’s English abilities; everyone speaks English significantly better than I speak French. I always wonder how that seems to be the case. One of them mentioned they lived in England for two years. It’s a common trend I’m noticing: Europeans with very good English have almost always lived in an English-speaking country for a significant period, six months or more. Since I’m the only native English speaker at the table, I feel a little pressure to speak English, as I’m sure it’s a good opportunity for them. I make sure to enunciate clearly and speak a little more slowly and simply to facilitate understanding.</p>

<p>Pretty much all the other people from my school are just hanging out and speaking English to each other, and I chat with them for a little bit before I leave. One girl is 16, and she asks one of the other students to buy her her very first alcoholic drink: sangria. I ask her what she’s doing at language school. She says her family is moving to France in a few years and she wants to be bilingual. She’s also a complete beginner; she started learning French last week. She asks me if I’m in college too, like many of the other students. I laugh and say that’s a compliment. She says she’s not sure which way I meant that and asks if I’m in high school. That’s my cue to leave, and I walk home.</p>

<p><em>Edit: The 16-year-old ended up puking after that one drink.</em></p>

<p><strong>June 19</strong></p>

<p>In my class, there’s also a young Russian guy. He’s been enrolled since September. I haven’t mentioned him because he skipped class all of last week and only showed up a few times this week. He has a designer backpack and watch. He says he wants to study somewhere in France, but he hasn’t decided yet. I’m pretty sure he’s the son of a Russian oligarch or something. That’s a theme I’m noticing among people who are enrolled in language school for a very long time—they probably don’t take each day too seriously since they’ve been here so long. After months and months of school, why not skip a few classes and take it easy? There aren’t any consequences since they can’t get held back or kicked out; they’ve already paid for school. And honestly, good for them. Life's too short to spend all your time in language school. </p>

<p>One of the students in my intensive class in the afternoon is really good. I wondered why she was put in the same class as me until I realized it was because there weren't enough people to have an “advanced” class unless they put scrubs like me in there too. She lived in Paris for three years and is now looking to perfect her French. She quit her job for a while and is doing the super-intensive class, which includes private lessons as well.</p>

<p><strong>June 20</strong></p>

<p>By now, I’ve pretty much established my routine during the week. I wake up around 7:30 in the morning, get ready, and prepare my usual breakfast: instant oats with a banana. I chat with Lydia for a few minutes, who gets up around the same time, and at 8:30, I grab my stuff and catch the train. It takes about 25 minutes to get to school from door to door, in the center of Montpellier. From 9:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., I have three hours of class with a 15-minute break in between. I usually just stay in class and chat with some of the other students or grab some coffee from the break room. At 12:15, the standard course ends, and I have my intensive class from 12:30 to 2:00. No one else in my morning class is taking the intensive course, so it’s all new people. I pack and eat the same lunch every day—some baked chicken breast and rice I meal-prepped before the week started. It’s bland and repetitive, but it’s perfect as a meal I can eat between classes, and I don’t want to eat out for every meal. After class ends at 2:00, I either go somewhere to study, like a coffee shop or library, and study until around 6:00 or 7:00. Sometimes I play bridge in the afternoon, which goes from 2:30 to 6:30. When I’m done, I find a restaurant and dine in. Then I go home, do some more studying (or work on this blog), and go to bed around midnight.</p>

<p>Today I played bridge. The club is, without a doubt, the softest bridge club I have ever played in. The people there play as if they’ve never taken a single bridge lesson. Whenever I take time to think, they’re surprised, as if they didn’t know thinking was allowed. Someone mentioned that it’s more like a social club—a place for retirees to socialize and hang out. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. Everyone is exceptionally nice, and people talk to me after the game for a pretty long time.</p>

<p>We placed first.</p>

<p><strong>June 21</strong></p>

<p>Today I went on a day trip to Sète with another student, Mira. She’s in the class below me, so I don’t have class with her, but she goes to a lot of the school events, which is how I got to know her. She’s a master's student in Canada. She used to be in a full French immersion program in Canada, but after attending a normal high school, she said she forgot a lot. She randomly decided to do five weeks of language school with no prep before her summer semester abroad in Germany and Italy. When she speaks French, she has such a strong, stereotypical American accent that it throws me off. I’m not sure if I should mention it or try to help her. I feel like she’d take it the wrong way, so I haven’t said anything. Anyway, she mentioned she wanted to go to Sète because she loves the beach, and I needed a reason to get out of Montpellier.</p>

<p>Sète is only a 20-minute train ride away from Montpellier. It’s a beach town that gets a lot of tourists. We share our experiences learning French—she says she wishes the school taught more useful skills, like how to order food or get around. She says people switch to English immediately after she starts speaking in French. She wants to sound more natural, more native, and she says it kills her to sound so foreign. I told her I felt the opposite; it doesn’t bother me if I have an accent or if I don’t sound totally natural in all situations. I’d rather be able to have a real conversation in the language. I’ve heard people say that when you learn a language later in life, you’ll always have an accent, but that doesn’t bother me at all. I’d rather have an accent and talk about something interesting than be able to order a ham and cheese sandwich without anyone knowing I’m American.</p>

<p>She tells me about her roommates, her school, her city, and the things she’s worried about. It’s a little disorienting to hear about the things on her mind. They’re things I haven’t had to worry about in many years. It makes me feel like our worlds are so far apart. I don’t mean it in a condescending way in the slightest, but more in a wistful, vaguely envious way. I listen and nod, and I don’t offer any advice. She’ll figure it out.</p>

<p>There’s something called water jousting in Sète. Two massive boats, each with a dozen or so rowers, power straight into each other so that a jouster perched on top of each can try to knock the other off their perch. They have literal local teams that compete to see who can knock off the most opponents. Life isn’t so different here in Sète; we have USTA tennis leagues, and they have water jousting competitions.</p>

<p><strong>June 22</strong></p>

<p>Last night I went to “La Fête de la Musique.” Apparently, it’s celebrated all over Europe and is a big deal in France, though it must not be a thing in the US. I went to get noodles at a local Chinese chain. I tried to order in French, but the host couldn’t understand my accent. I kept insisting on using French, but the host just switched to English and served me that way. The entire staff was from China, speaking Chinese to each other and using French and English to serve customers. As I was eating, I sighed to myself. The staff had to use their third language to serve me. Learning a language is truly so much harder than I expected. </p>

<p>By 9:00 p.m., downtown Montpellier was absolutely packed—like claustrophobic, fire-hazard levels of crowded. Many intersections were so full of people that it was physically impossible to get to the heart of downtown. There were little rock bands, DJs, rappers, and singers every 20 feet on every street, with impromptu crowds and dance floors in front of each one.</p>

<p>I went on a walking tour of Montpellier. What I learned:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 30px;">
	<li>There is a ton of street art in Montpellier.</li>
	<li>Montpellier is tiny.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our tour guide is a student at a local Montpellier university studying 3D animation. She came from Colombia a few years ago without knowing any French. She speaks very good English, having lived in Austin for a couple of years during high school. The classes at her university are technically taught in English, but 80% of her classmates are French, so between classes, everyone switches to French. She was also enrolled in French classes as part of her university program. I thought it was kind of random that she came here for school, and she agreed.</p>

<p>Today we have several new students: two young girls from Germany and one young man from Ireland. His name is Luca. Luca is the first student I’ve seen get promoted; he came from the class below. He’s 17 years old and said he spent summers in France as a kid. He’s a bit shy, which is totally understandable since he probably feels like he’s new in a more advanced class.</p>

<p>Romina is from Iran. She’s in high school and wants to study animation. She doesn’t have any concrete plans for how long she’ll be here, but she’s thinking of staying for about a year. She has bright blue hair and a septum piercing. I asked if the conflict in Iran had anything to do with her coming to Montpellier, but she said no, it was just a coincidence. She’s very chatty, more so than me. Between classes, she likes to make conversation with the other students in English or French.</p>

<p>Sonja has been in my class the entire time I’ve been here, but she doesn’t always show up. She was in class today, and I was able to catch her before she left. Sonja just graduated high school and is about to go to college but is taking a gap year. She’s been at the school since March and will be here until July. She works as an au pair. She has a lot of German friends here in Montpellier who are also au pairs, so after they tuck the kids in at night, they go out from 10:00 p.m. until the early morning. As a result, Sonja doesn’t make it to every class. And honestly, good for her. Language school gets monotonous after a while, and you have to live it up.</p>

<p>I played bridge in the afternoon. It was a disaster; everything that could go wrong went wrong. My partner, Henri, is a super nice guy but not a disciplined player. We still placed about average in the field.</p>

<p>I went to the MO.CO. art museum.</p>

<p><strong>June 24</strong></p>

<p>The two young girls from Germany are gone. I heard from someone that the class was too hard and they had asked to be moved to the class below.</p>

<p>In my intensive class, they shifted the groups around, so now it’s intermediate/advanced, and I’m the most “advanced” person in the class. One of the new people is David. David has been here for four weeks already and has signed up for a total of 12. He’s struggling a little bit in the class, but no one gives him a hard time. We all understand; we’ve been there. </p>

<p>Mira is also in this intensive class and has been in class with David from the beginning. She tells me he’s not having a good time and that he isn’t going to finish the 12 weeks he signed up for. She says he’s always super negative and self-flagellating in their normal class and outside of it. She thinks it’s because he’s a successful person (a doctor and professor) and is struggling to cope with his lack of success in learning a language.</p>

<p>On our way out of class, I talked with David a little bit. He’s retired now, so he picked up French as a hobby. He tells me his goal is to become “fluent.” He had come to this language school last year as well. He’s in the same class this year as he was last year. He says his biggest difficulty is with oral comprehension, to which I can relate. He says he’s been taking lessons three times a week for the last year, but I can tell that he doesn’t do much practice or get much input outside of his lessons. David reminds me a lot of myself. I thought learning a language would be easier, and after I put in a bunch of time and didn’t seem to be getting anywhere, I got pretty depressed too. I wonder what David is going to do now that he’s facing this dilemma. Will he give up learning completely? Will he redouble his efforts? I should get his number so I can follow up with him.</p>

<p><strong>June 25</strong></p>

<p>Today I joined another school event. We went to eat crêpes. Our guide was Marie, as usual, who leads all the extracurricular activities organized by the school. We met in front of the school at 7:00 p.m. and headed to the crêperie. I always try to speak French with some of the other students, but I find there is always a reluctance to do so during these events. Marie speaks English perfectly (no surprise) as she works for the school, but even then, I feel like I need to summon the courage to speak to her in French. Very few others take advantage of this opportunity. There were nearly 20 other people on this excursion, and the vast majority of them didn’t even attempt to speak French with her or each other. I should have known this coming in, but I take this way too seriously. </p>

<p>There’s another language exchange happening tonight. As the crêpe event was wrapping up, I tried to convince people to come with me. It was only a few minutes away, and I successfully rallied a small group. We got there around 9:00 p.m., much later than the last time I came, and it was way more packed. I went to the “International Chatters” table, and the organizer greeted me. I told her I wanted to speak French, and she pointed me to a group of students from another language school. This group of four students goes to ILA, another language school in the area, and they looked to be in their mid-50s. Their French was noticeably better than mine. They said they were in the same course at ILA, at the C1 level. One person was originally from Spain and moved to Montpellier last year. Another person was Swedish and drove his electric car 2,000 kilometers from Sweden to Montpellier (I said I didn’t know that was possible to do the whole way; he said it is, but he brought his car over on a boat anyway). They were super nice and included me in their conversation, which was all in French. Maybe I enrolled at the wrong school; maybe there are more adults at ILA, and I enrolled in the school with all the kids.</p>

<p>I noticed that the group I came with had all disappeared. I’m not surprised; they seemed shy, and it’s understandably intimidating to try to speak with strangers in a language you’re not great at. Before I could head out, I was approached by two French people who asked what languages I wanted to speak. I suggested we speak in English since that’s what I can offer as a native speaker. The two of them, a man and a woman, were both really passionate about languages. That’s how they met—both of them are seriously learning Japanese. A third French guy came up to us and joined our conversation.</p>

<p>After a while, it dawned on me that the reason I was so popular was that I was Asian, and these guys were hoping I was Japanese so they could practice. They told me that France is the biggest consumer of Japanese culture outside of Japan, which honestly isn’t that surprising. I did get a chance to speak a little French and gave a slightly rehearsed spiel about myself. They were very nice and complimentary.</p>

<p><strong>June 26</strong></p>

<p>Gwen is the other young American in my class (yes, I count myself as young). I finally managed to talk to her for a little bit. She’s been here for five weeks and is leaving the same week as me. She mentioned she works out of a café called “Café Solo,” and I decided I would find her there to ask her more questions.</p>

<p>That afternoon, when I walked into Café Solo, she was loitering at the counter. I said hi, and she told me to sit anywhere and she’d take my order. That’s weird, I thought, why would she take my order? Is she on good terms with the owner or something? Well, it turns out I had completely misunderstood what she meant, because when she said she works at the café, she meant she <em>works</em> there. She has a part-time “job” at Café Solo after school from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. (job in quotations because she doesn’t get paid). As a result, she doesn’t do any homework; she goes to class from 9:00 to 12:00, works from 2:00 to 6:00, and then goes back to her host family. She said the first few weeks she would go out, but now she just stays at home on the weekends and plays The Sims. I tell her about my project to hear everyone’s stories. She laughs and says she’s noticed. “I’ve never met anyone so interested in other people. It’s beautiful,” she said in a very cool, New York way.</p>

<p>This is Gwen's story, as best as I can recall her words:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p>“The French kids were brutal; they would bully me constantly because of my accent. So when I was in my teens, I refused to speak French. I didn’t want anything to do with the language. But now that I’m older and in college, I decided to take it up again. I just booked five weeks of language school here for fun, not for school or anything. And the language is coming back really fast.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gwen is clearly one of the best at French in the class without even trying. She just improvises everything and does great. She said she learned way more from the job than in class.</p>

<p>Also, Gwen is the gossip queen:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
	<li>The real reason Teo always misses class is because he’s going out with his boyfriend.</li>
	<li>Sonja was dating another German boy in the class, Felix, who was promoted to C1 right before I joined. “Can you believe she was his first kiss at 19? Maybe I’m just a hater.” Gwen, chill. I don’t know Felix, but you don’t have to do him like that. Then Sonja broke up with Felix. She says the two of them still hang out with the other Germans, but they’re both upset with the whole situation.</li>
	<li>Sonja also skips class because she doesn’t like Claire (our teacher). </li>
	<li>There was someone accidentally put in our B2 class. “She was, like, A1. It was soooo bad. One time, Claire had her email open, and I saw she had sent an email about it labeled URGENT.” The girl was eventually moved to a different class.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>June 27</strong></p>

<p>Earl is a fifty-something-year-old, heavyset, Filipino or Japanese-American guy. He’s in the C1 class and has been living in a penthouse in Montpellier for the last year. He used to work in finance and now is basically retired. He goes to a lot of the group events, and he drinks a lot. Today we went to a rooftop bar through an event organized by the school, and Earl was there. He dominates the conversation. I wonder if he realizes it. I try to start little side conversations with the other people there, especially the ones who are a bit quiet. To me, Earl is the stereotype of the middle-aged, single guy who moves abroad and lives lavishly. I’ll give him credit for committing to learning French and not just moving to the Philippines or Thailand like many other expats. </p>

<p>It’s the last day, and Hanna is the last person from my class I had a chance to chat with. She was smoking a cigarette outside the school, so I assumed she must have been pretty old. She’s 18, from the Czech Republic, and she just graduated from high school. She said she’s been smoking since she was 13 and that her “heavy smoking days” are behind her. She’s very well-dressed; she wore a completely different outfit to class every day this week. She wears sunglasses outside but doesn’t put them on, instead leaving them in her hair (“it’s just for the look”). She says everyone in the Czech Republic has no ambition, and she was that way too, but this summer she decided to be “less Czech” and booked language school for eight weeks. She took a 22-hour bus ride because she’s afraid of flying. She says she spends her time after class going to the beach, reading books in Czech, and drinking beer. What a European. </p>

<p>I went to Reflet d'Obione, a one-star Michelin restaurant, for dinner.</p>

<p><strong>June 29</strong></p>

<p>I left my homestay today. Lydia said my French has improved, and while I’m sure that’s true, it’s still so hard. She showed me pictures of her family. I asked about them, and she used the opportunity to scroll through her phone and show me her six kids and all her grandkids. None of them went to college. One owns a hair studio, another is the director of a local pool, another designs and makes leather goods, and one is a special-needs teacher, etc. Everyone lives a pretty normal, mundane French life. I showed her pictures of my family as well. She asked me about my dad, so I pulled up some old pictures I had saved online. She seemed a little sad, but mostly relieved that I was leaving. She’s been hosting for months straight, and I think she really looks forward to a break. She says hosting is extremely taxing for her, partially because she can’t spend the day in the nude as she’s used to.</p>

<p>Things we talked about in the last three weeks:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
	<li><b>Things aren’t as good as they used to be</b> - She’s mentioned at least five separate times how the government is screwing over the elderly ever since the pandemic. Everything is more expensive now than it used to be.</li>
	<li><b>World War 3</b> - She’s deathly afraid of it happening, for the sake of her kids.</li>
	<li><b>Her former host children</b> - She tells me about each one and where they’re from, and she compares them all the time.</li>
	<li><b>Singing range</b> - She was talking about how all the great singers had eight-octave vocal ranges; I felt obligated to explain to her that this was a misconception.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>June 30 / July 1</strong></p>
<p>I got to Lyon and immediately became very sick, probably because of the lingering stress from school and travel. After a long train ride, a cramped bus ride, and a labored walk up a tall hill in 95-degree heat, I finally checked into my hotel at 5:00 p.m. I spent nearly the next 24 hours in bed. My Oura Ring said I had a 102-degree fever. I did manage to make it out of my hotel around 7:00 p.m. the next day and walked around for two hours before grabbing dinner at a local <em>bouchon lyonnais</em> restaurant. I ordered a quenelle and nibbled on it for an hour. I must have looked so miserable because the staff kept coming by to check if I was okay. Lyon was nice; I will need to visit again when I’m not sick.</p>

<p><strong>July 2 - July 12</strong></p>
<p>I took a bus to Milan to meet my friend Jeff. Later, we met our friend Baxter in Nice. I’ll skip these days because it was mostly us doing vacation stuff. I feel like it’s not very interesting to write about the things we did. It was a lot of fun, but it’s normal vacation stuff. I guess this blog is really about my solo traveling, my language learning journey, and my thoughts on it. Ask me about this part of the trip later if you see me in real life.</p>

<p><strong>July 13</strong></p>
<p>In the evening, I dragged all my stuff from my hotel to the 15th arrondissement to meet my host family—or should I say host mother since it’s just one person. Her name is Véronique, and she’s 61 years old. I had sent her a written intro via email with my picture the week before to make our initial meeting go more smoothly. She was there to greet me when I got off the elevator on her floor. Her apartment is huge; I have my own bedroom and a private bathroom, and there’s another empty bedroom where her daughter used to live. I dropped my stuff in my room, and we went to chat in the living room. Véronique is a really excellent host mother. She’s so interested in chatting, getting me to speak, and correcting me when I make certain mistakes. She’s also very complimentary of my French, saying things like, “Your level is so impressive after just one year.” It actually came as a big surprise since I hadn’t been working on it for the last two weeks, and it’s hard to tell how much progress I’ve made since I arrived in France. Also, it’s clearly different when you’re with someone who has experience with students learning a new language. My host mother said she used to have American university students stay with her for three months at a time while they studied abroad for a semester, as well as other adult students who attend language school. They see how difficult it is to learn a language.</p>

<p><strong>July 14</strong></p>

<p>It’s Bastille Day in France, and there are lots of festivities tonight. At one point during the day, I brought Jeff to visit my apartment and my host mother since we had about an hour to kill before our dinner reservation. I basically chatted with Véronique in French the entire time (sorry, Jeff; I felt it would have been rude to speak English to you while we were in her home). I was feeling a bit sick and nauseous from eating so much rich food every day for the past two weeks, and I debated staying home, but Véronique insisted I go out and see the fireworks with Jeff and Baxter.</p>

<p>So I did.</p>

<p><strong>July 15</strong></p>

<p>I woke up a little later than expected, but I wanted to get to the school before 9:00 a.m., when class starts, because I had no idea what was going on. I managed to get to the address they gave me by 8:40, but there was nothing there, just a random door. I thought maybe they had closed in the time between when I registered and now. I scrambled through my emails and found an email they had sent me four months ago with a code to open the door, so I was able to get inside the building and find the floor where the school was. I was the first one there. It turns out this school is tiny. They don't have much staff. The first teacher walked in a little after I did, and we chatted for a bit. I told her this was my first day. She asked me what level I was, and even though I was in the B2 class in Montpellier, I said B1 because that’s closer to my true level. The email said there would be a test to place me in the correct class, but what I didn’t realize was that *was* the test—they just put me in the B1 class. There are two other people in the class. One person is new, like me. Her name is Johanna, and she’s from Germany. The other is Isabel. She’s from the USA/Ecuador. The class size is amazingly small. I can see we will get a lot of attention this way. </p>

<p>The class goes from 9:00 to 11:00, then 11:30 to 1:00, with a 30-minute break in between. During the break, I chatted with Johanna and a couple of other people who lingered in the break room. Like in Montpellier, everyone switches to English outside of class. Almost everyone is young, but more like college or master's student age, so I’m a bit more at ease. I talked to a teacher and discovered there are four classes here: A1, A2, B1, and B2. Each class has about 4 to 6 students, so I feel quite lucky to be in such a small class. </p>

<p>When 11:30 rolled around, it was just me and Johanna. Isabel only does the morning session. So the two of us and the teacher just chatted for a good while about what we’re doing here. Johanna is 25 and from Frankfurt, Germany. She works in Berlin in something political/governmental (not super sure), and she wants to learn French to do something related to politics (she already speaks perfect English, as you would expect from any young German person). She’s very talkative and emotive, and she comes across as very German too. Actually, she reminds me of the young Americans who are very hip and outgoing. Because the class is so small, I felt like I got a lot out of it. The level basically doesn’t matter. The teacher engages us based on what we can do.</p>

<p>After class, I went to the Google office nearby, as was my plan. I ate lunch, did some personal work, stayed until dinner at Google to eat another free meal, and then headed back to my homestay. Véronique is so welcoming, and we talked for at least an hour after I got back. I feel like in an environment like this, you can really make a lot of progress. I can’t believe I only have two weeks left…</p>

<p><strong>July 16</strong></p>

<p>There’s a new person in class today: Oskar. He was just sick the day before, so the class size is actually four. He’s from Copenhagen, Denmark. Compared to Montpellier, I feel like the classes here are much more personalized and practical. In Montpellier, we were always following a program or curriculum and reading or listening to pre-written material. Over there, it was like they were teaching to a test. In this school, it’s pretty much all discourse, talking, and listening, with grammar and vocab work in between. It seems really effective and laid back. I’m a big fan, actually. I don’t care at all about certificates or anything.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I invited my classmates who were still there, Oskar and Johanna, to join me at Google. They were both super impressed. Oskar and Johanna get along well. They’re both European and are super interested in politics. They chatted about the current state of European politics for about an hour. I learned a lot. Basically, what’s happening with Trump and the extreme right is happening everywhere in Europe, with varying responses by each country. Specifically, it seems driven by immigration policy. Every country doesn’t really like immigrants, which fuels right-wing movements. Apparently, in Denmark, the left-wing party crushed the burgeoning right-wing party by adopting their immigration policy, rendering the movement impotent. “But in a way, the right-wing won because they got what they wanted, right?” mused Oskar. </p>

<p>Oskar is a real free spirit. He solo travels something like every month. He’s only 24 years old, but he mentioned he’s visited Berlin 23 times, among countless other places. He’s moved to Paris for two months and is just starting: three weeks of language school and another four weeks just to hang out. He bought a cheap vintage bike and rides it around without a helmet. He works for a film festival and museum in Denmark, and he really loves it and takes his job seriously. It’s completely different from the type of people you meet in SF: power, status, and money-hungry. They don’t make a lot in Denmark comparatively, but it seems like a nice life to live so freely and earn just enough to do what you want.</p>

<p>I went to the gym for the first time today. I weighed myself and wasn’t surprised, but I’ve lost 15 pounds since the beginning of my trip. Now that I’m taking it super easy and have all this free food around me, I’m going to do my best to start gaining it back. I did a set of squats at 185, and my legs were absolutely dead. Just two months earlier, I was squatting 285 pounds for 5 reps as a work set. Now, a single set of 185 x 5 is an incredible struggle. I know from experience not to overdo it on my return to the gym, so I kept the gym session very short and went home.</p>

<p><strong>July 17</strong></p>

<p>Johanna and Oskar mentioned in class today that they had visited the Google office with me. After class, Isabel asked if I could talk to her boyfriend and give him career advice. We did some arranging, and I invited her boyfriend, Henri, to the Google office for dinner. Henri works freelance for two clients right now but said he would love to break into a large tech company like Google one day and asked for advice. I gave him a referral and the best advice I could, but I admitted that the circumstances were completely different from the current market. The hard part is getting the interview, he says. He gets auto-rejected instantly from most places. My advice was to use his network to get referrals instead of applying directly through the job portal. I also mentioned that freelancing might be a red flag, which surprised him. I said that as someone going through a CV, I would have no idea if the freelance experience was real or not. It’s so easy to fake. That surprised him. A large percentage of working French people are freelancers, and it can be a big advantage for avoiding taxes. After getting the interview, I told him to prepare for it with LeetCode. I also advised him to be open to moving out of France, especially to America. He said he’s totally game to do so. It’s just that he needs a company to sponsor his visa. It makes me realize that being born American has some advantages.</p>

<p>Back home, Véronique invited her best friend, her friend's daughter, and her own daughter for dinner. They invited me to stay and chat with them before dinner was served, which I graciously accepted. Véronique’s daughter, Agnès, is a bundle of energy and was speaking super fast to everyone, so I was trying my very best to pick up bits and pieces of what was being said. Agnès just finished the first of her two master's degrees at a school associated with the Louvre, and she’s working in a museum. She’s outspoken and has a lot of opinions. When Véronique had dinner all prepped and ready, she invited me to eat with them. I had already eaten, but I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to share a real moment with a French family. They spoke to each other like normal, occasionally stopping to give me an explanation of what was going on. Dinner went on until midnight, which isn’t that unusual in France. When it was time to wrap up and go, Agnès stayed behind since she could sleep in her childhood room. We talked for a bit, just the two of us. She seemed a little sad. She mentioned she and her mom don’t always see eye to eye. She grew up Catholic but isn’t religious anymore. She said she usually takes the homestay students on a museum tour, and I said I would gladly accept a tour this weekend. </p>

<p><strong>July 18</strong></p>

<p>Up until now, I had been eating at Google for lunch and dinner. It’s only a twenty-minute walk from the school, and it’s so nice to have a healthy and free lunch and dinner all set up for me. I could go to the gym, nap, or work in between. But today, Friday, the office was closed for dinner, so Véronique made me dinner tonight (I paid for meals as part of the homestay). She made a simple meal: pasta, mushrooms, and chicken breast. We had cheese and bread after, which I notice is consistently present after dinner. Then we had leftover dessert from yesterday. Véronique is a great conversationalist and teacher. She’s funny, corrects my mistakes, is complimentary and attentive, and is happy to chat for hours. </p>

<p>I met up with my classmates at night. They met up to have drinks by the Seine. We spent a couple of hours chatting away. They all came mostly alone, so I understand they are leaning on each other as friends to do things with. Isabel, Johanna, and Oskar are all between 24 and 26 years old, so I can’t help but feel a little bit like a black sheep. At about 1:00 a.m., Isabel led the group to a dance club. I politely declined. While the rest called a car to keep the night going, I took the metro home.</p>

<p><strong>July 19</strong></p>

<p>Today I played bridge with Antony. I first met him in Toronto in 2011 at my first bridge nationals. He was playing on the UC Berkeley bridge team at the time. I knew him as that Asian guy who spoke English with a French accent. I’ve never hung out with him, but I knew he had been in Paris and still plays bridge, so I got his contact from a mutual friend. We got crêpes together before the game, then he gave me a quick tour as we walked to the playing site. Antony is 37 and a professor in Paris. He says he liked living in California but prefers the European, Parisian culture.</p>

<p>The game was hit or miss. We ended up at 55%. I played a 7NT hand that could be made with either a squeeze or a simple finesse. I was pretty sure the finesse was off, but I took it because I didn't see that the entries for the squeeze were available. In fact, there was a double squeeze working on the hand that I missed completely. It made me realize that I’m kind of washed up at bridge. I would have found the best line in 2018 or 2019.</p>

<p>Antony gave me another tour of the Champs-Élysées. He was very complimentary of my French, even though I only said bits and phrases the whole day. He said that because I have only been doing it for about a year, I’ve reached a good level for just a year and a bit. After we reached the end of the Champs-Élysées, he took off, and I took the Metro home.</p>

<p>At home, Véronique had a guest over. It turns out her cousin’s daughter is spending a few nights here in Agnès' room before leaving for a vacation in Portugal. This news came out of nowhere, and I wasn’t sure how to feel about sharing the apartment with a stranger. She said hi to me in English. Her name is Lou. She looks like a French model. She’s impeccably dressed and speaks just how I imagine a Parisian French model would, but she’s from a suburb of Rennes. I hope she’s nice and is willing to speak to me in French.</p>

<p><strong>July 20</strong></p>

<p>Today was the day Agnès and I had agreed to go to a museum. She picked the AI exhibition since Véronique had let it be known that I wasn’t the biggest fan of museums. We agreed to meet at her apartment in the morning. Agnès lives in a <em>chambre de bonne</em>, which literally translates to "maid's room". In those really Parisian buildings with five or six stories, each story contains a different class of person. The elites live on the lower levels in nice apartments, and at the very top floor are all the workers and maids. The apartment is just a room with a shared bathroom in the hallway, although there is also a tiny shower in the apartment directly beside the front door. Agnès is an artist. The room is the size of a small dorm room and is completely cluttered with paintings, books, plants, and clothes on top of the furniture, a table, and rugs. The little sofa folds out into a bed, but there is barely enough room to navigate around the apartment. It turns out Agnès had invited Lou, who I guess is her cousin, to our museum trip, so we waited a little bit for her to arrive. This made me a little nervous. I wasn’t sure how spending the day with two young French girls I’d barely met would go. Lou came in and brought croissants, and the two girls chatted for a while. They were both nice enough to stop and explain or translate certain things and switched to English a few times. We spent a couple of hours inside while we waited for the rain to pass.</p>

<p>The AI exhibition was incredible. As someone who uses it pretty regularly, it’s interesting to see the intersection of AI and art (in fact, I use Gemini to format the HTML for this blog). Agnès had to leave while I was there, so Lou and I finished the exhibit on our own. We finished around 4:00 p.m. and got some açaí bowls to tide us over until dinner since we hadn’t eaten anything but a single croissant each all day. Lou works as a freelance UX/UI designer (see, freelance is so French). She’s also a part-time model (see, I was right). She comes from a very Protestant family and has recently rededicated herself to her church. It also happens to be a source of conflict between her and Agnès, which came up briefly in their conversation that morning.</p>

<p>Lou and I headed back to Véronique's since we were both staying there. Agnès came back a little later, and Véronique made dinner for us. Agnès and Véronique, the daughter and mom, had a heated conversation that I didn’t fully comprehend. Véronique was on the verge of tears at one point. After Agnès left to go home, Véronique explained that their worldviews are too different and they always end up fighting. Véronique loves her daughter, but I can see that she’s also worried about her.</p>

<p><strong>July 21</strong></p>

<p>There’s a new person in class today, Sarah. She was in the A2 class last week but asked to be moved up to B1 this week, which she said she had to fight for. I think she lacks a lot of the basics in French, but she tries her best to speak French and to participate, which I respect. I asked her about her story after class. She’s from Chicago but decided to move to Paris for a year, where she has some extended family. She said she didn’t have many friends in Chicago, and that starting a new life in Paris has been satisfying. I had seen her the week before in the break room. She seems eager to meet the other students and do things after class together. From the way the students interact during breaks and after school, it doesn’t seem like people really want to hang out. I’m definitely not helping the situation. All I want to do after class is go to my office, eat lunch, and relax. </p>

<p><strong>July 22</strong></p>

<p>There’s another new person in my class today, David, who is the first older person. He’s in his 60s, he’s a lawyer, and he was in the B2 class the previous day but moved down to the B1 level. He said he came to the school two years ago, where he was also in the B1 class. I wonder if he felt like he *must* be B2 now since he was in B1 two years ago, and was disappointed. I feel like this is a consistent story I see in students. They think that time alone is enough to improve in the language. We now have five people in the class, so it's not as small as it used to be. </p>

<p>We had a school activity after class. They organized a walking tour of Belleville, the 20th arrondissement. There were only a few of us who decided to go. David was there and brought his husband, also named David, who was a student at the school two years ago with the David from my class. Sarah was there, and also a 16-year-old Chinese guy who’s in the B2 class. He has a Chinese name and his native language is Chinese, but he’s been living in Hungary for the last eight years and attending an international French school there. He said his family moved to Hungary primarily for his education. What a sacrifice. His father dropped him off at the meeting point, so it seems his dad is following him everywhere. I don’t remember his name, but the Chinese student is very shy. He looks a bit like a typical young, nerdy Chinese mainlander. He's a little overweight, has a bowl cut, and a baby mustache because he hasn’t started shaving yet. It’s hard to tell how good his French is because he’s so shy. He speaks very softly and doesn’t say much, but he doesn’t have the strong Chinese accent I thought would be typical.</p>

<p>Historically, Belleville used to be a separate city, but it was annexed by Paris in 1860. Because the tax was lower in Belleville, all the historic restaurants are on the Belleville side. Now Belleville looks like Chinatown. Every store has Chinese characters on it. Our guide explained that many immigrants from all countries have been coming to Belleville for the last century: Polish, Turkish, Chinese, etc. Belleville was home to an early commune that inspired a work by Karl Marx, and that ultra-liberal feeling persists today. It’s a popular place for students and young people to hang out.</p>

<p><strong>July 23</strong></p>

<p>This is my last week of class, with a few days to go, and at this point, I’m pretty burnt out from learning. I don’t do any review after class anymore, nor do I listen to podcasts or work on my vocabulary. I’m clearly the strongest person in my class. I should have asked to be put in the most advanced class, but I don't really have the motivation at the moment. I’ve met some of the people in the B2 class. There’s Harry, a Vietnamese-Korean kid who speaks at least English and Korean fluently and is on his way to French fluency. He’s been here for four months already and is planning to take his B2 test this week. There’s a Dutch guy who speaks very well. There’s a Latina woman who’s been living in France for a while. In the one conversation we had in the break room with everyone else, she talked about how she forces her French boyfriend to speak to her in French, even when they both speak English well. And of course, there is the 16-year-old Chinese boy. I wonder what it would be like to be in B2. It’s such a different group of people.</p>

<p>Since we’re both living under the same roof, Lou and I have a lot of opportunities to chat. Her English is way better than my French, but we take turns chatting in French and English and correcting each other’s mistakes. It’s like a language exchange. Actually, we chat more in English than in French. My excuse is that it’s late when I get home and I’m too tired to speak French well. Also, Lou has fewer opportunities to speak English than I do French, since I have language school and Véronique. Véronique often ends her sentences with <em>“tu vois?”</em> which means, “you see?” This seems like a pretty common filler word, like how I say “you know?” in English. The funniest expression I’ve learned so far is when you don’t want to finish your sentence you can say <em>“naninana,”</em> which Lou told me is like “blah blah blah” in English. </p>

<p><strong>July 24</strong></p>

<p>My homestay only lasts until Sunday morning, but I leave Paris on Tuesday. I told Véronique I would manage and that I could book a hotel for the remaining days, but she told me not to worry about it and to just stay. I was already planning to get a gift for her, but now I feel like I can really go all out. I’m not sure what exactly to get Véronique, but I know what to get for her daughter, Agnès. Agnès plays piano, is classically trained, and mentioned to me that she was interested in writing songs. She has a ukulele and guitar, but I noticed in her tiny flat that her guitar is a cheap classical one, not a folk acoustic guitar. For most people, it wouldn’t seem like a big difference, but I’ve played both enough to know that a classical guitar is shaped differently enough that it's actually a pain to play pop or folk music on it. So I had already conceived the idea to buy an acoustic guitar for Agnès, which I think will be the best way to show my appreciation to Véronique.</p>

<p>There’s a street near the Pigalle train station that’s littered with guitar shops. Today I swung by after school and lunch to check out some guitars. The cheapest one was 150 euros and played like crap, so I opted for a slightly nicer guitar at 240 euros. It was a bit more than I was expecting, but I feel the payoff will be more than worth it. I know that the gift will be deeply appreciated for a long time and that I could, in a small way, change someone’s life. I like to think I’m good at giving gifts. I try to get something that shows I understand a person well and that I listened when they talked about their hopes and dreams. Véronique was surprised when I brought the guitar home, but she was happy to accept it. Agnès is on vacation for two weeks, and I told Véronique to keep it a secret until Agnès came back to Paris. As for a gift for Véronique, I have another idea that hopefully will be realized and reported in a future entry.</p>

<p><strong>July 25</strong></p>

<p>Today is the last day of school for me and most of the students in my class, and our teacher, Marroshka, brought croissants for all of us. Marroshka is from Paris, appears to be in her 30s, and is “self-employed,” which seems common for language teachers. Full-time employment, or a <em>CDI</em>, in France is actually relatively rare because it’s so hard to fire someone. That’s why there are so many freelancers. In Marroshka’s case, she’s her own “company” and is “hired” by the school to teach classes, but it isn't considered full-time work at all. In the afternoon, she teaches at another school, Accord Paris. I actually looked into this school as well. I asked which one she thought was better, and she said L’Atelier 9, my school, but that could have just been to protect my feelings. After class, I chatted with Marroshka for a bit. She asked why I elected to stay in her class when it was clear I should have moved up. I didn’t have a good answer. I said I liked my classmates and the way she taught, and that I learned a lot of grammar rules I honestly didn’t know. But I think deep down I’m just tired. I talk enough in the current class and at home, and I don't have the energy to keep pushing right now.</p>

<p>We were supposed to have a celebration hosted by the school after class, but when class ended at 1:00 and I went to the break room, it was empty. Turns out the celebration was canceled because the school president didn’t show up today, and everyone just went home. I was disappointed. I was looking forward to meeting the rest of the school whom I hadn’t met up until that point. Johanna wanted to get our classmates in B1 and some of the others in the other classes to meet up tonight, so we created a group chat. I had some internal reluctance because I feel a gap in age and culture. I’m not really interested in going out drinking and dancing. I just want to rest and work on my personal stuff. But I’ll still hang out with others if they want to. It would be a shame if I didn’t. I watched the movie “Yes Man” when I was in high school, and that movie really resonated with me. The moral was basically to say yes to more things, and I’ve adopted that philosophy since. If I can’t think of a good reason to say no, I’ll say yes. That night the group chat was silent. I messaged Johanna directly to ask what she was up to after dinner, and I never got a response. So I’m guilt-free. I made an effort, and it didn’t end up happening. I could have made more of an effort in trying to organize something. It’s another thing to work on.</p>

<p><strong>July 26</strong></p>

<p>I didn’t get out of bed until 1:00 p.m. today. That’s the latest I’ve ever left my bed. I didn’t realize how sleep-deprived I’ve been this week. That explains why I’ve been lacking motivation and energy. Véronique was already preparing lunch: a <em>magret</em> (duck breast). Véronique didn’t have to make me lunch since technically I only paid for three dinners a week, but I can tell Véronique doesn’t think about it like that at all and treats me like a real guest or family. I really appreciate it, and it makes me feel very justified in getting her (or her daughter) a nice gift.</p>

<p>Lou had the idea of going to Versailles tonight. Every Saturday night, they open the garden for an evening promenade before ending with fireworks. Of course, I said yes. I’ve never been to Versailles, and it’s one of those touristy, must-do things. It would also be a great opportunity to spend more time with my host family and immerse myself further. So we bought tickets and went on our way. We had to take two different metro lines and a train for close to an hour and a half. On the train, we actually leave Paris proper and see the suburbs. They still look dense, but the houses are more like normal, single-family homes with lots of trees and nature. Eventually, we made it to Versailles, which looks like a nice, normal town. We walked to the palace, and it was huge. We got into the garden, and it was even more massive. We spent two hours walking through the garden, and I don’t think we saw all of it. They had classical and baroque music blasting from speakers throughout the garden and flamethrowers embedded in the grass launching bursts of fire in sync with the music. The garden was immaculately kept, with sculptures, art, and old buildings everywhere. There are many other types of events available, like a concert and ball inside one of the buildings, but our ticket didn’t include that part of the spectacle. It’s definitely a place worth coming back to, perhaps with friends.</p>

<p><strong>July 27</strong></p>

<p>I’ve shared many meals with Véronique now and have revealed little things about myself over time. Véronique is always so interested. I’ve talked about Google endlessly now. I tell her how I spend my entire afternoon at Google. I eat, work out, take naps, work on my personal things, etc. I tell her more about my perks, like that there are massages available anytime. My doctor is in the office where I work. There are Google offices all over the world, and I can just walk into any of them and use their facilities. I mentioned that I’m considering leaving Google, and she’s surprised that I would want to leave such a good situation. Somehow, I’m surprised to hear her say that. I’m in such a bubble in San Francisco. Tech is so normalized and saturated where I’m from that no one bats an eye when people discuss tech benefits or salaries. I’m just another generic tech person. But in France, I stand out a lot more. People are interested in tech, and they seem impressed by what I’ve done. It gives me perspective and confidence that I’m doing something interesting.</p>

<p>I also talked about my family. I told her how my dad had to smuggle himself from mainland China to Hong Kong to start a new life in San Francisco and how he brought the rest of our family along after. I told her this is a normal story for a lot of my friends’ parents. I know one guy whose dad, instead of paying to get smuggled through like everyone else, swam from China to Hong Kong alone. I told her how my dad’s first job was selling ice cream and my mom worked at Burger King. Eventually, my parents brought their entire family to San Francisco, so I have an enormous number of cousins in the Bay Area, and we’re all close. “Why did they come?” Véronique asked. Véronique grew up on a farm in Bretagne, but because her family owned the farm and land, they were comfortable. But I told her that it was not a good life in China for my family, and they took the risk to come to America for a better life. I concluded by telling her how my dad died young and how it affected my family. It literally never occurred to me prior to this moment, but my family's story is actually pretty interesting. I don’t know nearly all the details, but it makes me really motivated to interview my family members and piece together the whole story. Véronique told me that my mom must be proud of me. “Yes, I know,” I replied. Of that, I’m very aware.</p>

<p><strong>July 28</strong></p>

<p>I had no school today, so I went to Google in the morning to have breakfast and lunch before embarking on my main task for the day: buying manga. It had occurred to me when I was in a café with Jeff a few weeks earlier that I had seen some manga on a shelf, translated into French. Comic books seem like a really good way to learn a language. Reading is obviously great, but the main difficulty for me right now is that 1. most books are too hard, and 2. writing in French uses a very specific tense, so it’s not the same as spoken French. While it’s still good for learning French grammar and vocab, because the tenses are a little different, it’s not as useful for improving listening and speaking, which is more of what I care about. Manga seems like the perfect medium for that. Since the characters are “speaking,” the speech is written as it would be spoken in real life.</p>

<p>I had a couple of places on my list to buy manga. When I walked into the first place, the manga section was absolutely packed with people. I shouldn’t have been surprised. Apparently, outside of Japan, anime and manga are most popular in France. I browsed for an hour, scanning the bookstore for a series I liked. I wanted something more "slice of life" or realistic, with more dialogue and plot, as I thought that would be suitable for learning. I had some in mind: <em>March comes in like a lion</em>, which is slice of life and deals with themes of depression and personal growth, or <em>Monster</em>, a plot-based thriller with lots of exposition and dialogue. I’m familiar with both series, which I think is a plus, so when I’m reading and I don’t understand something, my prior knowledge will allow me to continue the story without getting lost. It’s my version of the popular advice for language learners to read Harry Potter in their target language. I didn’t see either title in the first bookstore, so I headed to the other one. In the second bookstore, it was equally packed. I found <em>Monster</em> and <em>March comes in like a lion</em>, but I decided to pick up the first two anthologies of <em>The Promised Neverland</em>, another story I am familiar with. I actually haven’t finished this series, and it’s also strongly plot-heavy with a lot of dialogue, so I’m happy with my choice.</p>

<p>In the evening, I gave Véronique a tour of Google and showed her some of the most impressive perks: the nap room, music room, massage room, and makeup room. “How does anyone have time to work?” she asked. I told her that even though these are all available, they're not used too often. People are working hard for the most part and are generally busy. We walked up and down the stairs, which are preserved from when the building was built in the 1800s, and I showed her one of the original rooms in the building with intricate wood paneling and a decorated ceiling. We had dinner in the office. Véronique was satisfied with the meal. It reminds me of when I gave my own mother a tour of the Google office. Once again, it gives me perspective. It’s objectively uncommon to have the benefits I get. It makes it easier to appreciate what I have.</p>
