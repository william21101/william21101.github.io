<p><strong>June 8</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at my host’s house in Montpellier at 10:30 PM. It seems like a quiet neighborhood with lots of surrounding trees. My host greeted me outside and brought me upstairs. She’s explaining everything in very simple French, and I mostly give one- or two-word answers. It turns out I have a roommate, but he’s spending the weekend in Barcelona and won’t be back until tomorrow night. His name is Josh, and he’s from Australia.</p>

<p><strong>June 9</strong></p>
<p>It’s a holiday, and I don’t have anything to eat, so I found a fast-food shop nearby on the way to the grocery store. When I approached the counter, I led with something like “Excuse my poor French,” in French. The guy looked confused and asked, “English?” and asked another guy in the back to help me. With the new guy, I kept speaking French. “Why the hell did you call me out here for?” he asked the other guy as he helped me with my order.</p>
<p>At the hypermarket, I circled around forever looking for things I needed. As I checked out, I prayed everything would go smoothly. There was a moment where it looked like my credit card wasn’t working, but it did.</p>

<p><strong>June 10</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at school at 8:15 for orientation with 14 other new students and went to a room. A couple of people were chatting in English or another language, but otherwise, we sat in absolute silence. Everyone was nervous and unsure. A teacher came by and handed out our class schedules and welcomed us. We gave introductions (in French or English). At 9:00, everyone was dismissed to go to their first class. I realized on my course sheet that they put me in the class labeled “Advanced.” I thought there was supposed to be an in-person, oral test. They put me in the advanced class just because of an online test I took three months ago? That I may or may not have looked up some of the answers for? I was hoping they’d calibrate me after I got here.</p>
<p>When I entered class, I almost burst out laughing. There are 9 other people in the class, and every single other person appears to be a teenage girl. The teacher asks me to introduce myself. I go through my well-practiced personal intro, and I hope I can fake my way enough through this and through the day before I ask to be moved to another class. And thus followed 4.5 hours of French instruction, from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with two 15-minute breaks.</p>
<p>I headed home early right after class to call it a day. I took a nap.</p>

<p><strong>June 11</strong></p>
<p>It's my second day at school. The dynamic here isn't like normal school; the best way I can describe it is like being in Saturday morning Chinese school when I was in grade school. I can tell no one is close to each other. They must have all registered independently. It's also clear that many don't really try that hard, like they don’t really care to be there. Before class starts, everyone chats in English, but during class, everyone is painfully quiet. I sympathize with the professor who is trying to get the class to participate. Whenever the silence lingers too long, I volunteer and go for it. I don't worry about sounding bad, I think it helps everyone feel more at ease. It’s easier because I’m older, maybe the others feel some peer pressure.</p>
<p>During breaks, all the girls chat to each other in English again as they leave the room. I'm so curious why each person is here. I want to ask everyone what they're doing here.</p>
<p>Today, there's a new person in class, Teo. He's Asian and a guy, so he seems a lot more approachable than anyone else. During our first break, I summoned the courage to talk to him. I asked him what he was doing here in French, and to my surprise, he responded with excellent English. He’s Korean and he's been studying French here for five months already, for a total of ten months. He's 20 years old and wants to go to university in Paris in the future. He was hand-rolling tobacco into a cigarette as we chatted before leaving to smoke it. You can tell he’s the type of person who is cool.</p>
<p>There are two more people who consistently don't leave with the other girls during the break: Victoria and Manami. Victoria is from Russia, and Manami is from Japan. They've both been here a few weeks. Victoria is staying until next week, and Manami until August. Neither of them speak much English, so they are particularly alienated from the rest of the class. They're both here purely for pleasure. I also learned they are surprisingly older, like me, in their 30s. It’s not obvious at all.</p>

<p>It's become apparant that "Advanced" is an inflated title. The material we're covering is very basic. The teacher explained that the class is for learners who are "approaching" an advanced level, and we're just at the beginning of level B2.</p>
<p>Also it's become clear to me that there’s a lot of variance in ability in my class. There are quite a few who speak very well, naturally and fluidly, and others who struggle to put a sentence together. I sympathize because it’s scary trying to speak a new language. It’s especially hard when you don’t speak English. French and English are so similar that learning it as a native English speaker must be several times easier than with a completely unrelated language. I’d say the ability among the students ranges from A2 to B2,which is very wide, and I’m somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>The school organizes afternoon activities for its students, and I decided to finally participate and meet some other people. We were going to the Banksy exhibition on the outskirts of the city. I met up in front of the school with the others, who, unsurprisingly, were all speaking English, except for one guy speaking French so fluently I assumed he wasn’t part of the school until he started following our group. His name is Jon (pronounced YON), he's Swiss, and in C1, the class above mine. He mentioned he's taking the C1 certification test on Tuesday, so it's no surprise he has such incredible fluency. Jon and I chatted with each other during our commute to the exhibition. His native language is German, but he speaks flawless English, as you would expect from an educated Swiss. He really liked to talk about Swiss politics and what it's like to be Swiss, and I reciprocated as best I could in French. When things got too complicated, he switched to English and continued the conversation from there, and then one of us would switch back to French when we felt like it. While we were on the train, which was packed to the brim, I wondered what a funny sight the two of us must have been.</p>
<p>We ended up grabbing dinner together. When we entered the restaurant, the host said something to us at lightning speed that neither of us understood. "English menus?" the host asked us. We politely declined and told him we were practicing. Even with countless hours of study and an imminent C1 certification, small, simple interactions can sometimes still be hard. And just because the server asks if you need English menus, it doesn't mean you can't continue in French. They're probably just used to people actually being bad at French.</p>

    I learned that Banksy produces batches of art regularly. He made 1500 copies of this modified Paris Hilton record, all serialized and released to the wild. You can buy one for a few thousand dollars.

<p>Josh left this morning. While he was here, he woke up at 6:00 a.m. every morning for work. I could hear him having meetings in his room. He went to another language school, and his class started at 2:00 p.m., so he didn't come home until relatively late. In the brief time we overlapped, he was rarely in the mood to talk when he returned in the evening, but I was able to chat with him briefly. He’s pretty much exactly the same as me: we’re the same age and came to Montpellier to study and immerse ourselves in a language that we picked at random. He’s a consultant at Deloitte and had the flexibility to work and immerse himself at the same time. He’s leaving for Greece just for fun, and then he’s going to a wedding.</p>

<p>Today was the last day of class for two girls, Clara and Riley. I learned separately that Clara was part of a group from an international high school in Cape Town, South Africa; they had many 8th and 9th graders and a single 11th grader. During the class, Clara and I were paired together to do some exercises, so I took the opportunity to ask her a few questions during the break.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><b>Will:</b> You’re with the group from South Africa, right? I met your chaperone yesterday at the Banksy excursion. You must be the 11th grader they mentioned.</p>
	<p><b>Clara:</b> Oh, you think I’m in 11th grade? I’m in eighth grade. I’m 14 years old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out Clara is an absolute infant. Her French is so good because her parents speak French. When she speaks, she has an excellent accent, and I was sure to compliment her on that. While we were speaking, Riley came back from break, and we filled her in. I asked her what she was doing here at language school. Riley is a collegiate athlete on a scholarship, and as a result, she’s not allowed to study abroad if she intends to keep her scholarship. Her university has a program where they come to Accent Français for three weeks at the end of May as a pseudo-abroad program. But she’s the only one in the advanced class; all of the other kids from her school are in classes below. Then she asked me a question.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> Ok I’m been trying to place you but I can’t figure it out…how old are you??</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> Uh sure I can tell you, it’s not a secret…</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> …</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> …</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> So??? Do you want me to guess???</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> No no…I’m 32…</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> WHAT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isabel (high school student from Mexico/North Carolina) comes back from break</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> ISABEL GUESS HOW OLD HE IS</p>
	<p><strong>Isabel:</strong> uhhh i don’t know</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> HE’S 32</p>
	<p><strong>Isabel:</strong> whattt <em>*covers face with hand*</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gwen (college student from New York City) walks in</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> GWEN. GUESS HOW OLD HE IS</p>
	<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> Uh I dunno like 25?</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> HE’S 32</p>
	<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> Yeah that’s not that weird, I guessed mid to late 20s </p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> YOU SAID 25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole time I was feeling very embarrassed. I guess it’s good that people think I look young, but clearly, these girls think 32 is ancient.</p>

<p>The turnout for Pride today in Montpellier is impressive. It has a very young and liberal feel; I see queer folks absolutely everywhere. The slogan that’s everywhere is “MONTPELLIER T’AIME,” which I think is funny because in the Paris airports you see “PARIS VOUS AIME.” Both mean “[city] loves you,” except Paris is formal and Montpellier is informal. I guess Montpellier is making a statement about being chill, or trying to avoid getting sued by Paris.</p>

<p>After walking around forever, I grabbed dinner at YURICHA. I sat outside because that was the only seating available, which was a mistake because the street is extremely narrow and I’m surrounded by smokers, so it’s like eating inside a casino.</p>
