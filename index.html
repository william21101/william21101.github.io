<p><strong>June 8</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at my host’s house in Montpellier at 10:30 PM. It seems like a quiet neighborhood with lots of surrounding trees. My host greeted me outside and brought me upstairs. She’s explaining everything in very simple French, and I mostly give one- or two-word answers. It turns out I have a roommate, but he’s spending the weekend in Barcelona and won’t be back until tomorrow night. His name is Josh, and he’s from Australia.</p>

<p><strong>June 9</strong></p>
<p>It’s a holiday, and I don’t have anything to eat, so I found a fast-food shop nearby on the way to the grocery store. When I approached the counter, I led with something like “Excuse my poor French,” in French. The guy looked confused and asked, “English?” and asked another guy in the back to help me. With the new guy, I kept speaking French. “Why the hell did you call me out here for?” he asked the other guy as he helped me with my order.</p>
<p>At the hypermarket, I circled around forever looking for things I needed. As I checked out, I prayed everything would go smoothly. There was a moment where it looked like my credit card wasn’t working, but it did.</p>

<p><strong>June 10</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at school at 8:15 for orientation with 14 other new students and went to a room. A couple of people were chatting in English or another language, but otherwise, we sat in absolute silence. Everyone was nervous and unsure. A teacher came by and handed out our class schedules and welcomed us. We gave introductions (in French or English). At 9:00, everyone was dismissed to go to their first class. I realized on my course sheet that they put me in the class labeled “Advanced.” I thought there was supposed to be an in-person, oral test. They put me in the advanced class just because of an online test I took three months ago? That I may or may not have looked up some of the answers for? I was hoping they’d calibrate me after I got here.</p>
<p>When I entered class, I almost burst out laughing. There are 9 other people in the class, and every single other person appears to be a teenage girl. The teacher asks me to introduce myself. I go through my well-practiced personal intro, and I hope I can fake my way enough through this and through the day before I ask to be moved to another class. And thus followed 4.5 hours of French instruction, from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with two 15-minute breaks.</p>
<p>I headed home early right after class to call it a day. I took a nap.</p>

<p><strong>June 11</strong></p>
<p>It's my second day at school. The dynamic here isn't like normal school; the best way I can describe it is like being in Saturday morning Chinese school when I was in grade school. I can tell no one is close to each other. They must have all registered independently. It's also clear that many don't really try that hard, like they don’t really care to be there. Before class starts, everyone chats in English, but during class, everyone is painfully quiet. I sympathize with the professor who is trying to get the class to participate. Whenever the silence lingers too long, I volunteer and go for it. I don't worry about sounding bad, I think it helps everyone feel more at ease. It’s easier because I’m older, maybe the others feel some peer pressure.</p>
<p>During breaks, all the girls chat to each other in English again as they leave the room. I'm so curious why each person is here. I want to ask everyone what they're doing here.</p>
<p>Today, there's a new person in class, Teo. He's Asian and a guy, so he seems a lot more approachable than anyone else. During our first break, I summoned the courage to talk to him. I asked him what he was doing here in French, and to my surprise, he responded with excellent English. He’s Korean and he's been studying French here for five months already, for a total of ten months. He's 20 years old and wants to go to university in Paris in the future. He was hand-rolling tobacco into a cigarette as we chatted before leaving to smoke it. You can tell he’s the type of person who is cool.</p>
<p>There are two more people who consistently don't leave with the other girls during the break: Victoria and Manami. Victoria is from Russia, and Manami is from Japan. They've both been here a few weeks. Victoria is staying until next week, and Manami until August. Neither of them speak much English, so they are particularly alienated from the rest of the class. They're both here purely for pleasure. I also learned they are surprisingly older, like me, in their 30s. It’s not obvious at all.</p>

<p><strong>June 12</strong></p>
<p>It's become apparant that "Advanced" is an inflated title. The material we're covering is very basic. The teacher explained that the class is for learners who are "approaching" an advanced level, and we're just at the beginning of level B2.</p>
<p>Also it's become clear to me that there’s a lot of variance in ability in my class. There are quite a few who speak very well, naturally and fluidly, and others who struggle to put a sentence together. I sympathize because it’s scary trying to speak a new language. It’s especially hard when you don’t speak English. French and English are so similar that learning it as a native English speaker must be several times easier than with a completely unrelated language. I’d say the ability among the students ranges from A2 to B2,which is very wide, and I’m somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>The school organizes afternoon activities for its students, and I decided to finally participate and meet some other people. We were going to the Banksy exhibition on the outskirts of the city. I met up in front of the school with the others, who, unsurprisingly, were all speaking English, except for one guy speaking French so fluently I assumed he wasn’t part of the school until he started following our group. His name is Jon (pronounced YON), he's Swiss, and in C1, the class above mine. He mentioned he's taking the C1 certification test on Tuesday, so it's no surprise he has such incredible fluency. Jon and I chatted with each other during our commute to the exhibition. His native language is German, but he speaks flawless English, as you would expect from an educated Swiss. He really liked to talk about Swiss politics and what it's like to be Swiss, and I reciprocated as best I could in French. When things got too complicated, he switched to English and continued the conversation from there, and then one of us would switch back to French when we felt like it. While we were on the train, which was packed to the brim, I wondered what a funny sight the two of us must have been.</p>
<p>We ended up grabbing dinner together. When we entered the restaurant, the host said something to us at lightning speed that neither of us understood. "English menus?" the host asked us. We politely declined and told him we were practicing. Even with countless hours of study and an imminent C1 certification, small, simple interactions can sometimes still be hard. And just because the server asks if you need English menus, it doesn't mean you can't continue in French. They're probably just used to people actually being bad at French.</p>

<p><strong>June 13</strong></p>

<p>Josh left this morning. While he was here, he woke up at 6:00 a.m. every morning for work. I could hear him having meetings in his room. He went to another language school, and his class started at 2:00 p.m., so he didn't come home until relatively late. In the brief time we overlapped, he was rarely in the mood to talk when he returned in the evening, but I was able to chat with him briefly. He’s pretty much exactly the same as me: we’re the same age and came to Montpellier to study and immerse ourselves in a language that we picked at random. He’s a consultant at Deloitte and had the flexibility to work and immerse himself at the same time. He’s leaving for Greece just for fun, and then he’s going to a wedding.</p>

<p>Today was the last day of class for two girls, Clara and Riley. I learned separately that Clara was part of a group from an international high school in Cape Town, South Africa; they had many 8th and 9th graders and a single 11th grader. During the class, Clara and I were paired together to do some exercises, so I took the opportunity to ask her a few questions during the break.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><b>Will:</b> You’re with the group from South Africa, right? I met your chaperone yesterday at the Banksy excursion. You must be the 11th grader they mentioned.</p>
	<p><b>Clara:</b> Oh, you think I’m in 11th grade? I’m in eighth grade. I’m 14 years old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out Clara is an absolute infant. Her French is so good because her parents speak French. When she speaks, she has an excellent accent, and I was sure to compliment her on that. While we were speaking, Riley came back from break, and we filled her in. I asked her what she was doing here at language school. Riley is a collegiate athlete on a scholarship, and as a result, she’s not allowed to study abroad if she intends to keep her scholarship. Her university has a program where they come to Accent Français for three weeks at the end of May as a pseudo-abroad program. But she’s the only one in the advanced class; all of the other kids from her school are in classes below. Then she asked me a question.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> Ok I’m been trying to place you but I can’t figure it out…how old are you??</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> Uh sure I can tell you, it’s not a secret…</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> …</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> …</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> So??? Do you want me to guess???</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> No no…I’m 32…</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> WHAT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isabel (high school student from Mexico/North Carolina) comes back from break</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> ISABEL GUESS HOW OLD HE IS</p>
	<p><strong>Isabel:</strong> uhhh i don’t know</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> HE’S 32</p>
	<p><strong>Isabel:</strong> whattt <em>*covers face with hand*</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gwen (college student from New York City) walks in</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> GWEN. GUESS HOW OLD HE IS</p>
	<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> Uh I dunno like 25?</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> HE’S 32</p>
	<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> Yeah that’s not that weird, I guessed mid to late 20s </p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> YOU SAID 25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole time I was feeling very embarrassed. I guess it’s good that people think I look young, but clearly, these girls think 32 is ancient.</p>

<p>The turnout for Pride today in Montpellier is impressive. It has a very young and liberal feel; I see queer folks absolutely everywhere. The slogan that’s everywhere is “MONTPELLIER T’AIME,” which I think is funny because in the Paris airports you see “PARIS VOUS AIME.” Both mean “[city] loves you,” except Paris is formal and Montpellier is informal. I guess Montpellier is making a statement about being chill, or trying to avoid getting sued by Paris.</p>

<p>After walking around forever, I grabbed dinner at YURICHA. I sat outside because that was the only seating available, which was a mistake because the street is extremely narrow and I’m surrounded by smokers, so it’s like eating inside a casino.</p>

<p><strong>June 15</strong></p>

<p>I live with a host family. In this case it’s just one moment, it’s a single 69 retiree woman. Her name is Lydia. The first few days I was nervous to come out of my room to talk to her but it’s better now after a week of getting used to it. It helps that she’s used to hosting students so she has the right expectations, and she doesn’t speak too fast. </p>

<p>Lydia says she mainly hosts students for the money, and it’s clear that money is a constant concern for her. She asks me to unplug all my electronics when I’m out of the house, not to cook too much (since gas is expensive), not to take too long a shower, etc. She lives in government housing which controls her rent, but she used to have her own house seven years ago before finances became too constrained. She’s brought up three separate times how things started getting worse for the French people in 2020, and ever since then prices for everything have been increasing non stop. She says it’s the fault of the French government, and that she’ll never vote for Macron again.</p>

<p>She has two ex husbands, six kids, and even more grandkids. Today she went to a large family gathering with her kids and grandkids and their own families. The gathering was 30 kilometres away, and she hitched a ride with her ex husband. She doesn’t own a car. There were 28 people total. She’s very proud of her family, but she’d been on her feet for too long today so she has difficulty walking. </p>

<p>I appreciate Lydia. She makes an effort to speak with me everyday even when she’s feeling tired or hurt. She likes to complain and she’ll go on long tangents about whatever is bothering her at the moment. I don’t mind it because it gives me a chance to practice listening and communication. All and all, I have a lot of freedom and a good number of chances to speak, but I miss the comfort of home and living alone. I’m looking forward to AC when my stay here is over. </p>

<p><strong>June 16</strong></p>

<p>It’s a new week at school and some people have left and new people have joined. One of them is our first older student. Her name is Nicole, she’s in her 60s, and she’s come to this specific language school other times in the past. I sat next to her so we’re paired up for exercises that day. She has a really strong American accent and whenever she struggles to say something she starts speaking bits of English, like she’s desperate to be understood. It’s really distracting for me and actively detrimental for her. I wonder where this habit comes from, or if it’s a personality trait. When she switches to English to get her point across when she couldn’t in French, is it because it was an important thing for me to know? Or is it important for her to be comprehensible? What does it say about her personality? I’ll never know. </p>

<p>After class I mention very politely (1 on 1, not in front of anyone else except the teacher) her habit of using English and I recommend she try to only use French during the class. She seems like she has a lot of anxiety with speaking and her ability. She asks the teacher if she should drop to the class below, but the teacher says that class might be too basic. Personally I feel like dropping down a level would help with her confidence. Spending class riddled with anxiety can’t be a good situation for learning.</p>

<p>My intensive classes in the afternoon are with a completely different group of people. Last week it was a mix of students and older folks and we worked on random topics. Honestly it doesn’t seem that worth it. Today my intensive class only has three people. With a smaller group it’s really nice to get to ask questions and get a lot of attention. </p>

<p><strong>June 17</strong></p>

<p>After class I got ramen for dinner. There was no one inside when I walked in at 7pm, which is considered early for dinner. I was seated right next to where the cashier/server was stationed. I ordered successfully and after I received my food and we were both alone in the restaurant, I tried to make small talk. I asked him where he was from. Turns out he’s Chinese and he moved to Montpellier in 2004 for university for biology, he worked at a startup for a while and then quit to open a restaurant. He’s the only person working there at the moment. He said in the summer it’s normal for it to be this slow, but during the winter it’s much busier and he has to hire help. I tried to speak some Chinese to him and he did a double take. He thought I was Korean. I said it’s because of the hair.</p>

<p>Two customers came in and sat down and the guy went to serve them. I whispered “merci” and went back to eating. I thought it would be rude to continue to chat with him with other people in the room, but after he served the other group he came back to the station and kept chatting with me. I told him about why I was here and what my plans were. I asked him for restaurant recommendations. I asked him if there were a lot of Chinese people in Montpellier (there are, but in certain districts I guess). He said he knows all the other Chinese restaurant owners in the area, which he says are authentic and good. He said they all have to be a little bit strange to want to open a restaurant. He said go to Marché du Lez and get pigs feet from a stall. He said the best seafood is at this Chinese all you can eat buffet called “Top Grande”. By this point the entire restaurant had filled up, and he juggled taking orders, bringing out food, and going back to chatting with me.</p>

<p>Tonight I joined another after-school activity. Together we went to the café at La Panacée, which is an art museum, not to see art, but for a language exchange that happens every Wednesday. It’s in an open courtyard in the middle of the building, and it’s completely packed. There’s a table specifically for the exchange, called International Chatters, and I make my way over. I meet a few French people, and we take turns speaking French and English. I still feel like my comprehension is holding me back, so it’s hard to keep the conversation going in French because I always look unsure. I’m also endlessly impressed by everyone’s English abilities; everyone speaks English significantly better than I speak French. I always wonder how that seems to be the case. One of them mentioned they lived in England for two years. It’s a common trend I’m noticing: Europeans with very good English have almost always lived in an English-speaking country for a significant period, six months or more. Since I’m the only native English speaker at the table, I feel a little pressure to speak English, as I’m sure it’s a good opportunity for them. I make sure to enunciate clearly and speak a little more slowly and simply to facilitate understanding.</p>

<p>Pretty much all the other people from my school are just hanging out and speaking English to each other, and I chat with them for a little bit before I leave. One girl is 16, and she asks one of the other students to buy her her very first alcoholic drink: sangria. I ask her what she’s doing at language school. She says her family is moving to France in a few years and she wants to be bilingual. She’s also a complete beginner; she started learning French last week. She asks me if I’m in college too, like many of the other students. I laugh and say that’s a compliment. She says she’s not sure which way I meant that and asks if I’m in high school. That’s my cue to leave, and I walk home.</p>

<p><em>Edit: The 16-year-old ended up puking after that one drink.</em></p>

<p><strong>June 19</strong></p>

<p>In my class, there’s also a young Russian guy. He’s been enrolled since September. I haven’t mentioned him because he skipped class all of last week and only showed up a few times this week. He has a designer backpack and watch. He says he wants to study somewhere in France, but he hasn’t decided yet. I’m pretty sure he’s the son of a Russian oligarch or something. That’s a theme I’m noticing among people who are enrolled in language school for a very long time—they probably don’t take each day too seriously since they’ve been here so long. After months and months of school, why not skip a few classes and take it easy? There aren’t any consequences since they can’t get held back or kicked out; they’ve already paid for school. And honestly, good for them. Life's too short to spend all your time in language school. </p>

<p>One of the students in my intensive class in the afternoon is really good. I wondered why she was put in the same class as me until I realized it was because there weren't enough people to have an “advanced” class unless they put scrubs like me in there too. She lived in Paris for three years and is now looking to perfect her French. She quit her job for a while and is doing the super-intensive class, which includes private lessons as well.</p>

<p><strong>June 20</strong></p>

<p>By now, I’ve pretty much established my routine during the week. I wake up around 7:30 in the morning, get ready, and prepare my usual breakfast: instant oats with a banana. I chat with Lydia for a few minutes, who gets up around the same time, and at 8:30, I grab my stuff and catch the train. It takes about 25 minutes to get to school from door to door, in the center of Montpellier. From 9:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., I have three hours of class with a 15-minute break in between. I usually just stay in class and chat with some of the other students or grab some coffee from the break room. At 12:15, the standard course ends, and I have my intensive class from 12:30 to 2:00. No one else in my morning class is taking the intensive course, so it’s all new people. I pack and eat the same lunch every day—some baked chicken breast and rice I meal-prepped before the week started. It’s bland and repetitive, but it’s perfect as a meal I can eat between classes, and I don’t want to eat out for every meal. After class ends at 2:00, I either go somewhere to study, like a coffee shop or library, and study until around 6:00 or 7:00. Sometimes I play bridge in the afternoon, which goes from 2:30 to 6:30. When I’m done, I find a restaurant and dine in. Then I go home, do some more studying (or work on this blog), and go to bed around midnight.</p>

<p>Today I played bridge. The club is, without a doubt, the softest bridge club I have ever played in. The people there play as if they’ve never taken a single bridge lesson. Whenever I take time to think, they’re surprised, as if they didn’t know thinking was allowed. Someone mentioned that it’s more like a social club—a place for retirees to socialize and hang out. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. Everyone is exceptionally nice, and people talk to me after the game for a pretty long time.</p>

<p>We placed first.</p>

<p><strong>June 21</strong></p>

<p>Today I went on a day trip to Sète with another student, Mira. She’s in the class below me, so I don’t have class with her, but she goes to a lot of the school events, which is how I got to know her. She’s a master's student in Canada. She used to be in a full French immersion program in Canada, but after attending a normal high school, she said she forgot a lot. She randomly decided to do five weeks of language school with no prep before her summer semester abroad in Germany and Italy. When she speaks French, she has such a strong, stereotypical American accent that it throws me off. I’m not sure if I should mention it or try to help her. I feel like she’d take it the wrong way, so I haven’t said anything. Anyway, she mentioned she wanted to go to Sète because she loves the beach, and I needed a reason to get out of Montpellier.</p>

<p>Sète is only a 20-minute train ride away from Montpellier. It’s a beach town that gets a lot of tourists. We share our experiences learning French—she says she wishes the school taught more useful skills, like how to order food or get around. She says people switch to English immediately after she starts speaking in French. She wants to sound more natural, more native, and she says it kills her to sound so foreign. I told her I felt the opposite; it doesn’t bother me if I have an accent or if I don’t sound totally natural in all situations. I’d rather be able to have a real conversation in the language. I’ve heard people say that when you learn a language later in life, you’ll always have an accent, but that doesn’t bother me at all. I’d rather have an accent and talk about something interesting than be able to order a ham and cheese sandwich without anyone knowing I’m American.</p>

<p>She tells me about her roommates, her school, her city, and the things she’s worried about. It’s a little disorienting to hear about the things on her mind. They’re things I haven’t had to worry about in many years. It makes me feel like our worlds are so far apart. I don’t mean it in a condescending way in the slightest, but more in a wistful, vaguely envious way. I listen and nod, and I don’t offer any advice. She’ll figure it out.</p>

<p>There’s something called water jousting in Sète. Two massive boats, each with a dozen or so rowers, power straight into each other so that a jouster perched on top of each can try to knock the other off their perch. They have literal local teams that compete to see who can knock off the most opponents. Life isn’t so different here in Sète; we have USTA tennis leagues, and they have water jousting competitions.</p>
