<p>montpellier 1</p>

<p><strong>July 8</strong></p>

<p>i arrived at my host’s house in montpellier at 10:30pm. it seems like a quiet neighborhood with lots of surrounding trees. my host greeted me outside and brought me upstairs. she’s explaining everything in very simple french and in my exhaustion i give mostly one or two word answers. it turns out i have a roommate, but he’s spending the weekend in barcelona and won’t be back until tomorrow night. his name is Josh and he’s from Australia. that night i go to bed and pass out easily.</p>

<p><strong>July 9</strong></p>
<p>i wake up at 7am and finish a bunch of work for work that remained. i stay in my room until 12. i chat with my host for a little bit before she leaves. I decide I need to eat something soon since I skipped dinner last night, and I pick some fast foot shop nearby on the way to the grocery store. as I leave i realize I’m afraid to leave the house, because i’m scared to speak. finally i leave the house at 1.</p>

<p>at the little fast food shack i approach the counter and lead with “excuse my poor french” and say something poorly phrased in french. this was enough for him to call for someone in the back who speaks english. embarrassed, even with the new guy prompting me in english, i insist on continuing to speak french. “why the hell did you call me out here for” he says as he helps me with my order. i get my chicken plate and i eat it slowly in the restaurant. across from me are two indians who are speaking english, probably local students. the chicken is salty. i got to the hyper market and circle for ages to get the things i want. as i check out i pray everything goes smoothly here. there was a moment where it looked like my credit card wasn’t working, but it did. i go home and i cook, eat dinner, and go to bed.</p>
