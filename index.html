<p><strong>June 8</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at my host’s house in Montpellier at 10:30 PM. It seems like a quiet neighborhood with lots of surrounding trees. My host greeted me outside and brought me upstairs. She’s explaining everything in very simple French, and I mostly give one- or two-word answers. It turns out I have a roommate, but he’s spending the weekend in Barcelona and won’t be back until tomorrow night. His name is Josh, and he’s from Australia.</p>

<p><strong>June 9</strong></p>
<p>It’s a holiday, and I don’t have anything to eat, so I found a fast-food shop nearby on the way to the grocery store. When I approached the counter, I led with something like “Excuse my poor French,” in French. The guy looked confused and asked, “English?” and asked another guy in the back to help me. With the new guy, I kept speaking French. “Why the hell did you call me out here for?” he asked the other guy as he helped me with my order.</p>
<p>At the hypermarket, I circled around forever looking for things I needed. As I checked out, I prayed everything would go smoothly. There was a moment where it looked like my credit card wasn’t working, but it did.</p>

<p><strong>June 10</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at school at 8:15 for orientation with 14 other new students and went to a room. A couple of people were chatting in English or another language, but otherwise, we sat in absolute silence. Everyone was nervous and unsure. A teacher came by and handed out our class schedules and welcomed us. We gave introductions (in French or English). At 9:00, everyone was dismissed to go to their first class. I realized on my course sheet that they put me in the class labeled “Advanced.” I thought there was supposed to be an in-person, oral test. They put me in the advanced class just because of an online test I took three months ago? That I may or may not have looked up some of the answers for? I was hoping they’d calibrate me after I got here.</p>
<p>When I entered class, I almost burst out laughing. There are 9 other people in the class, and every single other person appears to be a teenage girl. The teacher asks me to introduce myself. I go through my well-practiced personal intro, and I hope I can fake my way enough through this and through the day before I ask to be moved to another class. And thus followed 4.5 hours of French instruction, from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with two 15-minute breaks.</p>
<p>I headed home early right after class to call it a day. I took a nap.</p>

<p><strong>June 11</strong></p>
<p>It's my second day at school. The dynamic here isn't like normal school; the best way I can describe it is like being in Saturday morning Chinese school when I was in grade school. I can tell no one is close to each other. They must have all registered independently. It's also clear that many don't really try that hard, like they don’t really care to be there. Before class starts, everyone chats in English, but during class, everyone is painfully quiet. I sympathize with the professor who is trying to get the class to participate. Whenever the silence lingers too long, I volunteer and go for it. I don't worry about sounding bad, I think it helps everyone feel more at ease. It’s easier because I’m older, maybe the others feel some peer pressure.</p>
<p>During breaks, all the girls chat to each other in English again as they leave the room. I'm so curious why each person is here. I want to ask everyone what they're doing here.</p>
<p>Today, there's a new person in class, Teo. He's Asian and a guy, so he seems a lot more approachable than anyone else. During our first break, I summoned the courage to talk to him. I asked him what he was doing here in French, and to my surprise, he responded with excellent English. He’s Korean and he's been studying French here for five months already, for a total of ten months. He's 20 years old and wants to go to university in Paris in the future. He was hand-rolling tobacco into a cigarette as we chatted before leaving to smoke it. You can tell he’s the type of person who is cool.</p>
<p>There are two more people who consistently don't leave with the other girls during the break: Victoria and Manami. Victoria is from Russia, and Manami is from Japan. They've both been here a few weeks. Victoria is staying until next week, and Manami until August. Neither of them speak much English, so they are particularly alienated from the rest of the class. They're both here purely for pleasure. I also learned they are surprisingly older, like me, in their 30s. It’s not obvious at all.</p>

<p><strong>June 12</strong></p>
<p>It's become apparant that "Advanced" is an inflated title. The material we're covering is very basic. The teacher explained that the class is for learners who are "approaching" an advanced level, and we're just at the beginning of level B2.</p>
<p>Also it's become clear to me that there’s a lot of variance in ability in my class. There are quite a few who speak very well, naturally and fluidly, and others who struggle to put a sentence together. I sympathize because it’s scary trying to speak a new language. It’s especially hard when you don’t speak English. French and English are so similar that learning it as a native English speaker must be several times easier than with a completely unrelated language. I’d say the ability among the students ranges from A2 to B2,which is very wide, and I’m somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>The school organizes afternoon activities for its students, and I decided to finally participate and meet some other people. We were going to the Banksy exhibition on the outskirts of the city. I met up in front of the school with the others, who, unsurprisingly, were all speaking English, except for one guy speaking French so fluently I assumed he wasn’t part of the school until he started following our group. His name is Jon (pronounced YON), he's Swiss, and in C1, the class above mine. He mentioned he's taking the C1 certification test on Tuesday, so it's no surprise he has such incredible fluency. Jon and I chatted with each other during our commute to the exhibition. His native language is German, but he speaks flawless English, as you would expect from an educated Swiss. He really liked to talk about Swiss politics and what it's like to be Swiss, and I reciprocated as best I could in French. When things got too complicated, he switched to English and continued the conversation from there, and then one of us would switch back to French when we felt like it. While we were on the train, which was packed to the brim, I wondered what a funny sight the two of us must have been.</p>
<p>We ended up grabbing dinner together. When we entered the restaurant, the host said something to us at lightning speed that neither of us understood. "English menus?" the host asked us. We politely declined and told him we were practicing. Even with countless hours of study and an imminent C1 certification, small, simple interactions can sometimes still be hard. And just because the server asks if you need English menus, it doesn't mean you can't continue in French. They're probably just used to people actually being bad at French.</p>

<p><strong>June 13</strong></p>

<p>Josh left this morning. While he was here, he woke up at 6:00 a.m. every morning for work. I could hear him having meetings in his room. He went to another language school, and his class started at 2:00 p.m., so he didn't come home until relatively late. In the brief time we overlapped, he was rarely in the mood to talk when he returned in the evening, but I was able to chat with him briefly. He’s pretty much exactly the same as me: we’re the same age and came to Montpellier to study and immerse ourselves in a language that we picked at random. He’s a consultant at Deloitte and had the flexibility to work and immerse himself at the same time. He’s leaving for Greece just for fun, and then he’s going to a wedding.</p>

<p>Today was the last day of class for two girls, Clara and Riley. I learned separately that Clara was part of a group from an international high school in Cape Town, South Africa; they had many 8th and 9th graders and a single 11th grader. During the class, Clara and I were paired together to do some exercises, so I took the opportunity to ask her a few questions during the break.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><b>Will:</b> You’re with the group from South Africa, right? I met your chaperone yesterday at the Banksy excursion. You must be the 11th grader they mentioned.</p>
	<p><b>Clara:</b> Oh, you think I’m in 11th grade? I’m in eighth grade. I’m 14 years old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out Clara is an absolute infant. Her French is so good because her parents speak French. When she speaks, she has an excellent accent, and I was sure to compliment her on that. While we were speaking, Riley came back from break, and we filled her in. I asked her what she was doing here at language school. Riley is a collegiate athlete on a scholarship, and as a result, she’s not allowed to study abroad if she intends to keep her scholarship. Her university has a program where they come to Accent Français for three weeks at the end of May as a pseudo-abroad program. But she’s the only one in the advanced class; all of the other kids from her school are in classes below. Then she asked me a question.</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> Ok I’m been trying to place you but I can’t figure it out…how old are you??</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> Uh sure I can tell you, it’s not a secret…</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> …</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> …</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> So??? Do you want me to guess???</p>
	<p><strong>Will:</strong> No no…I’m 32…</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> WHAT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isabel (high school student from Mexico/North Carolina) comes back from break</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> ISABEL GUESS HOW OLD HE IS</p>
	<p><strong>Isabel:</strong> uhhh i don’t know</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> HE’S 32</p>
	<p><strong>Isabel:</strong> whattt <em>*covers face with hand*</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gwen (college student from New York City) walks in</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> GWEN. GUESS HOW OLD HE IS</p>
	<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> Uh I dunno like 25?</p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> HE’S 32</p>
	<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> Yeah that’s not that weird, I guessed mid to late 20s </p>
	<p><strong>Riley:</strong> YOU SAID 25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole time I was feeling very embarrassed. I guess it’s good that people think I look young, but clearly, these girls think 32 is ancient.</p>

<p>The turnout for Pride today in Montpellier is impressive. It has a very young and liberal feel; I see queer folks absolutely everywhere. The slogan that’s everywhere is “MONTPELLIER T’AIME,” which I think is funny because in the Paris airports you see “PARIS VOUS AIME.” Both mean “[city] loves you,” except Paris is formal and Montpellier is informal. I guess Montpellier is making a statement about being chill, or trying to avoid getting sued by Paris.</p>

<p>After walking around forever, I grabbed dinner at YURICHA. I sat outside because that was the only seating available, which was a mistake because the street is extremely narrow and I’m surrounded by smokers, so it’s like eating inside a casino.</p>

<p><strong>June 15</strong></p>

<p>I live with a host family. In this case it’s just one moment, it’s a single 69 retiree woman. Her name is Lydia. The first few days I was nervous to come out of my room to talk to her but it’s better now after a week of getting used to it. It helps that she’s used to hosting students so she has the right expectations, and she doesn’t speak too fast. </p>

<p>Lydia says she mainly hosts students for the money, and it’s clear that money is a constant concern for her. She asks me to unplug all my electronics when I’m out of the house, not to cook too much (since gas is expensive), not to take too long a shower, etc. She lives in government housing which controls her rent, but she used to have her own house seven years ago before finances became too constrained. She’s brought up three separate times how things started getting worse for the French people in 2020, and ever since then prices for everything have been increasing non stop. She says it’s the fault of the French government, and that she’ll never vote for Macron again.</p>

<p>She has two ex husbands, six kids, and even more grandkids. Today she went to a large family gathering with her kids and grandkids and their own families. The gathering was 30 kilometres away, and she hitched a ride with her ex husband. She doesn’t own a car. There were 28 people total. She’s very proud of her family, but she’d been on her feet for too long today so she has difficulty walking. </p>

<p>I appreciate Lydia. She makes an effort to speak with me everyday even when she’s feeling tired or hurt. She likes to complain and she’ll go on long tangents about whatever is bothering her at the moment. I don’t mind it because it gives me a chance to practice listening and communication. All and all, I have a lot of freedom and a good number of chances to speak, but I miss the comfort of home and living alone. I’m looking forward to AC when my stay here is over. </p>

<p><strong>June 16</strong></p>

<p>It’s a new week at school and some people have left and new people have joined. One of them is our first older student. Her name is Nicole, she’s in her 60s, and she’s come to this specific language school other times in the past. I sat next to her so we’re paired up for exercises that day. She has a really strong American accent and whenever she struggles to say something she starts speaking bits of English, like she’s desperate to be understood. It’s really distracting for me and actively detrimental for her. I wonder where this habit comes from, or if it’s a personality trait. When she switches to English to get her point across when she couldn’t in French, is it because it was an important thing for me to know? Or is it important for her to be comprehensible? What does it say about her personality? I’ll never know. </p>

<p>After class I mention very politely (1 on 1, not in front of anyone else except the teacher) her habit of using English and I recommend she try to only use French during the class. She seems like she has a lot of anxiety with speaking and her ability. She asks the teacher if she should drop to the class below, but the teacher says that class might be too basic. Personally I feel like dropping down a level would help with her confidence. Spending class riddled with anxiety can’t be a good situation for learning.</p>

<p>My intensive classes in the afternoon are with a completely different group of people. Last week it was a mix of students and older folks and we worked on random topics. Honestly it doesn’t seem that worth it. Today my intensive class only has three people. With a smaller group it’s really nice to get to ask questions and get a lot of attention. </p>

<p><strong>June 17</strong></p>

<p>After class I got ramen for dinner. There was no one inside when I walked in at 7pm, which is considered early for dinner. I was seated right next to where the cashier/server was stationed. I ordered successfully and after I received my food and we were both alone in the restaurant, I tried to make small talk. I asked him where he was from. Turns out he’s Chinese and he moved to Montpellier in 2004 for university for biology, he worked at a startup for a while and then quit to open a restaurant. He’s the only person working there at the moment. He said in the summer it’s normal for it to be this slow, but during the winter it’s much busier and he has to hire help. I tried to speak some Chinese to him and he did a double take. He thought I was Korean. I said it’s because of the hair.</p>

<p>Two customers came in and sat down and the guy went to serve them. I whispered “merci” and went back to eating. I thought it would be rude to continue to chat with him with other people in the room, but after he served the other group he came back to the station and kept chatting with me. I told him about why I was here and what my plans were. I asked him for restaurant recommendations. I asked him if there were a lot of Chinese people in Montpellier (there are, but in certain districts I guess). He said he knows all the other Chinese restaurant owners in the area, which he says are authentic and good. He said they all have to be a little bit strange to want to open a restaurant. He said go to Marché du Lez and get pigs feet from a stall. He said the best seafood is at this Chinese all you can eat buffet called “Top Grande”. By this point the entire restaurant had filled up, and he juggled taking orders, bringing out food, and going back to chatting with me.</p>

<p>Tonight I joined another after-school activity. Together we went to the café at La Panacée, which is an art museum, not to see art, but for a language exchange that happens every Wednesday. It’s in an open courtyard in the middle of the building, and it’s completely packed. There’s a table specifically for the exchange, called International Chatters, and I make my way over. I meet a few French people, and we take turns speaking French and English. I still feel like my comprehension is holding me back, so it’s hard to keep the conversation going in French because I always look unsure. I’m also endlessly impressed by everyone’s English abilities; everyone speaks English significantly better than I speak French. I always wonder how that seems to be the case. One of them mentioned they lived in England for two years. It’s a common trend I’m noticing: Europeans with very good English have almost always lived in an English-speaking country for a significant period, six months or more. Since I’m the only native English speaker at the table, I feel a little pressure to speak English, as I’m sure it’s a good opportunity for them. I make sure to enunciate clearly and speak a little more slowly and simply to facilitate understanding.</p>

<p>Pretty much all the other people from my school are just hanging out and speaking English to each other, and I chat with them for a little bit before I leave. One girl is 16, and she asks one of the other students to buy her her very first alcoholic drink: sangria. I ask her what she’s doing at language school. She says her family is moving to France in a few years and she wants to be bilingual. She’s also a complete beginner; she started learning French last week. She asks me if I’m in college too, like many of the other students. I laugh and say that’s a compliment. She says she’s not sure which way I meant that and asks if I’m in high school. That’s my cue to leave, and I walk home.</p>

<p><em>Edit: The 16-year-old ended up puking after that one drink.</em></p>

<p><strong>June 19</strong></p>

<p>In my class, there’s also a young Russian guy. He’s been enrolled since September. I haven’t mentioned him because he skipped class all of last week and only showed up a few times this week. He has a designer backpack and watch. He says he wants to study somewhere in France, but he hasn’t decided yet. I’m pretty sure he’s the son of a Russian oligarch or something. That’s a theme I’m noticing among people who are enrolled in language school for a very long time—they probably don’t take each day too seriously since they’ve been here so long. After months and months of school, why not skip a few classes and take it easy? There aren’t any consequences since they can’t get held back or kicked out; they’ve already paid for school. And honestly, good for them. Life's too short to spend all your time in language school. </p>

<p>One of the students in my intensive class in the afternoon is really good. I wondered why she was put in the same class as me until I realized it was because there weren't enough people to have an “advanced” class unless they put scrubs like me in there too. She lived in Paris for three years and is now looking to perfect her French. She quit her job for a while and is doing the super-intensive class, which includes private lessons as well.</p>

<p><strong>June 20</strong></p>

<p>By now, I’ve pretty much established my routine during the week. I wake up around 7:30 in the morning, get ready, and prepare my usual breakfast: instant oats with a banana. I chat with Lydia for a few minutes, who gets up around the same time, and at 8:30, I grab my stuff and catch the train. It takes about 25 minutes to get to school from door to door, in the center of Montpellier. From 9:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., I have three hours of class with a 15-minute break in between. I usually just stay in class and chat with some of the other students or grab some coffee from the break room. At 12:15, the standard course ends, and I have my intensive class from 12:30 to 2:00. No one else in my morning class is taking the intensive course, so it’s all new people. I pack and eat the same lunch every day—some baked chicken breast and rice I meal-prepped before the week started. It’s bland and repetitive, but it’s perfect as a meal I can eat between classes, and I don’t want to eat out for every meal. After class ends at 2:00, I either go somewhere to study, like a coffee shop or library, and study until around 6:00 or 7:00. Sometimes I play bridge in the afternoon, which goes from 2:30 to 6:30. When I’m done, I find a restaurant and dine in. Then I go home, do some more studying (or work on this blog), and go to bed around midnight.</p>

<p>Today I played bridge. The club is, without a doubt, the softest bridge club I have ever played in. The people there play as if they’ve never taken a single bridge lesson. Whenever I take time to think, they’re surprised, as if they didn’t know thinking was allowed. Someone mentioned that it’s more like a social club—a place for retirees to socialize and hang out. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. Everyone is exceptionally nice, and people talk to me after the game for a pretty long time.</p>

<p>We placed first.</p>

<p><strong>June 21</strong></p>

<p>Today I went on a day trip to Sète with another student, Mira. She’s in the class below me, so I don’t have class with her, but she goes to a lot of the school events, which is how I got to know her. She’s a master's student in Canada. She used to be in a full French immersion program in Canada, but after attending a normal high school, she said she forgot a lot. She randomly decided to do five weeks of language school with no prep before her summer semester abroad in Germany and Italy. When she speaks French, she has such a strong, stereotypical American accent that it throws me off. I’m not sure if I should mention it or try to help her. I feel like she’d take it the wrong way, so I haven’t said anything. Anyway, she mentioned she wanted to go to Sète because she loves the beach, and I needed a reason to get out of Montpellier.</p>

<p>Sète is only a 20-minute train ride away from Montpellier. It’s a beach town that gets a lot of tourists. We share our experiences learning French—she says she wishes the school taught more useful skills, like how to order food or get around. She says people switch to English immediately after she starts speaking in French. She wants to sound more natural, more native, and she says it kills her to sound so foreign. I told her I felt the opposite; it doesn’t bother me if I have an accent or if I don’t sound totally natural in all situations. I’d rather be able to have a real conversation in the language. I’ve heard people say that when you learn a language later in life, you’ll always have an accent, but that doesn’t bother me at all. I’d rather have an accent and talk about something interesting than be able to order a ham and cheese sandwich without anyone knowing I’m American.</p>

<p>She tells me about her roommates, her school, her city, and the things she’s worried about. It’s a little disorienting to hear about the things on her mind. They’re things I haven’t had to worry about in many years. It makes me feel like our worlds are so far apart. I don’t mean it in a condescending way in the slightest, but more in a wistful, vaguely envious way. I listen and nod, and I don’t offer any advice. She’ll figure it out.</p>

<p>There’s something called water jousting in Sète. Two massive boats, each with a dozen or so rowers, power straight into each other so that a jouster perched on top of each can try to knock the other off their perch. They have literal local teams that compete to see who can knock off the most opponents. Life isn’t so different here in Sète; we have USTA tennis leagues, and they have water jousting competitions.</p>

<p><strong>June 22</strong></p>

<p>Last night I went to “La Fête de la Musique.” Apparently, it’s celebrated all over Europe and is a big deal in France, though it must not be a thing in the US. I went to get noodles at a local Chinese chain. I tried to order in French, but the host couldn’t understand my accent. I kept insisting on using French, but the host just switched to English and served me that way. The entire staff was from China, speaking Chinese to each other and using French and English to serve customers. As I was eating, I sighed to myself. The staff had to use their third language to serve me. Learning a language is truly so much harder than I expected. </p>

<p>By 9:00 p.m., downtown Montpellier was absolutely packed—like claustrophobic, fire-hazard levels of crowded. Many intersections were so full of people that it was physically impossible to get to the heart of downtown. There were little rock bands, DJs, rappers, and singers every 20 feet on every street, with impromptu crowds and dance floors in front of each one.</p>

<p>I went on a walking tour of Montpellier. What I learned:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 30px;">
	<li>There is a ton of street art in Montpellier.</li>
	<li>Montpellier is tiny.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our tour guide is a student at a local Montpellier university studying 3D animation. She came from Colombia a few years ago without knowing any French. She speaks very good English, having lived in Austin for a couple of years during high school. The classes at her university are technically taught in English, but 80% of her classmates are French, so between classes, everyone switches to French. She was also enrolled in French classes as part of her university program. I thought it was kind of random that she came here for school, and she agreed.</p>

<p>Today we have several new students: two young girls from Germany and one young man from Ireland. His name is Luca. Luca is the first student I’ve seen get promoted; he came from the class below. He’s 17 years old and said he spent summers in France as a kid. He’s a bit shy, which is totally understandable since he probably feels like he’s new in a more advanced class.</p>

<p>Romina is from Iran. She’s in high school and wants to study animation. She doesn’t have any concrete plans for how long she’ll be here, but she’s thinking of staying for about a year. She has bright blue hair and a septum piercing. I asked if the conflict in Iran had anything to do with her coming to Montpellier, but she said no, it was just a coincidence. She’s very chatty, more so than me. Between classes, she likes to make conversation with the other students in English or French.</p>

<p>Sonja has been in my class the entire time I’ve been here, but she doesn’t always show up. She was in class today, and I was able to catch her before she left. Sonja just graduated high school and is about to go to college but is taking a gap year. She’s been at the school since March and will be here until July. She works as an au pair. She has a lot of German friends here in Montpellier who are also au pairs, so after they tuck the kids in at night, they go out from 10:00 p.m. until the early morning. As a result, Sonja doesn’t make it to every class. And honestly, good for her. Language school gets monotonous after a while, and you have to live it up.</p>

<p>I played bridge in the afternoon. It was a disaster; everything that could go wrong went wrong. My partner, Henri, is a super nice guy but not a disciplined player. We still placed about average in the field.</p>

<p>I went to the MO.CO. art museum.</p>

<p><strong>June 24</strong></p>

<p>The two young girls from Germany are gone. I heard from someone that the class was too hard and they had asked to be moved to the class below.</p>

<p>In my intensive class, they shifted the groups around, so now it’s intermediate/advanced, and I’m the most “advanced” person in the class. One of the new people is David. David has been here for four weeks already and has signed up for a total of 12. He’s struggling a little bit in the class, but no one gives him a hard time. We all understand; we’ve been there. </p>

<p>Mira is also in this intensive class and has been in class with David from the beginning. She tells me he’s not having a good time and that he isn’t going to finish the 12 weeks he signed up for. She says he’s always super negative and self-flagellating in their normal class and outside of it. She thinks it’s because he’s a successful person (a doctor and professor) and is struggling to cope with his lack of success in learning a language.</p>

<p>On our way out of class, I talked with David a little bit. He’s retired now, so he picked up French as a hobby. He tells me his goal is to become “fluent.” He had come to this language school last year as well. He’s in the same class this year as he was last year. He says his biggest difficulty is with oral comprehension, to which I can relate. He says he’s been taking lessons three times a week for the last year, but I can tell that he doesn’t do much practice or get much input outside of his lessons. David reminds me a lot of myself. I thought learning a language would be easier, and after I put in a bunch of time and didn’t seem to be getting anywhere, I got pretty depressed too. I wonder what David is going to do now that he’s facing this dilemma. Will he give up learning completely? Will he redouble his efforts? I should get his number so I can follow up with him.</p>

<p><strong>June 25</strong></p>

<p>Today I joined another school event. We went to eat crêpes. Our guide was Marie, as usual, who leads all the extracurricular activities organized by the school. We met in front of the school at 7:00 p.m. and headed to the crêperie. I always try to speak French with some of the other students, but I find there is always a reluctance to do so during these events. Marie speaks English perfectly (no surprise) as she works for the school, but even then, I feel like I need to summon the courage to speak to her in French. Very few others take advantage of this opportunity. There were nearly 20 other people on this excursion, and the vast majority of them didn’t even attempt to speak French with her or each other. I should have known this coming in, but I take this way too seriously. </p>

<p>There’s another language exchange happening tonight. As the crêpe event was wrapping up, I tried to convince people to come with me. It was only a few minutes away, and I successfully rallied a small group. We got there around 9:00 p.m., much later than the last time I came, and it was way more packed. I went to the “International Chatters” table, and the organizer greeted me. I told her I wanted to speak French, and she pointed me to a group of students from another language school. This group of four students goes to ILA, another language school in the area, and they looked to be in their mid-50s. Their French was noticeably better than mine. They said they were in the same course at ILA, at the C1 level. One person was originally from Spain and moved to Montpellier last year. Another person was Swedish and drove his electric car 2,000 kilometers from Sweden to Montpellier (I said I didn’t know that was possible to do the whole way; he said it is, but he brought his car over on a boat anyway). They were super nice and included me in their conversation, which was all in French. Maybe I enrolled at the wrong school; maybe there are more adults at ILA, and I enrolled in the school with all the kids.</p>

<p>I noticed that the group I came with had all disappeared. I’m not surprised; they seemed shy, and it’s understandably intimidating to try to speak with strangers in a language you’re not great at. Before I could head out, I was approached by two French people who asked what languages I wanted to speak. I suggested we speak in English since that’s what I can offer as a native speaker. The two of them, a man and a woman, were both really passionate about languages. That’s how they met—both of them are seriously learning Japanese. A third French guy came up to us and joined our conversation.</p>

<p>After a while, it dawned on me that the reason I was so popular was that I was Asian, and these guys were hoping I was Japanese so they could practice. They told me that France is the biggest consumer of Japanese culture outside of Japan, which honestly isn’t that surprising. I did get a chance to speak a little French and gave a slightly rehearsed spiel about myself. They were very nice and complimentary.</p>

<p><strong>June 26</strong></p>

<p>Gwen is the other young American in my class (yes, I count myself as young). I finally managed to talk to her for a little bit. She’s been here for five weeks and is leaving the same week as me. She mentioned she works out of a café called “Café Solo,” and I decided I would find her there to ask her more questions.</p>

<p>That afternoon, when I walked into Café Solo, she was loitering at the counter. I said hi, and she told me to sit anywhere and she’d take my order. That’s weird, I thought, why would she take my order? Is she on good terms with the owner or something? Well, it turns out I had completely misunderstood what she meant, because when she said she works at the café, she meant she <em>works</em> there. She has a part-time “job” at Café Solo after school from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. (job in quotations because she doesn’t get paid). As a result, she doesn’t do any homework; she goes to class from 9:00 to 12:00, works from 2:00 to 6:00, and then goes back to her host family. She said the first few weeks she would go out, but now she just stays at home on the weekends and plays The Sims. I tell her about my project to hear everyone’s stories. She laughs and says she’s noticed. “I’ve never met anyone so interested in other people. It’s beautiful,” she said in a very cool, New York way.</p>

<p>This is Gwen's story, as best as I can recall her words:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 15px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
	<p>“The French kids were brutal; they would bully me constantly because of my accent. So when I was in my teens, I refused to speak French. I didn’t want anything to do with the language. But now that I’m older and in college, I decided to take it up again. I just booked five weeks of language school here for fun, not for school or anything. And the language is coming back really fast.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gwen is clearly one of the best at French in the class without even trying. She just improvises everything and does great. She said she learned way more from the job than in class.</p>

<p>Also, Gwen is the gossip queen:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
	<li>The real reason Teo always misses class is because he’s going out with his boyfriend.</li>
	<li>Sonja was dating another German boy in the class, Felix, who was promoted to C1 right before I joined. “Can you believe she was his first kiss at 19? Maybe I’m just a hater.” Gwen, chill. I don’t know Felix, but you don’t have to do him like that. Then Sonja broke up with Felix. She says the two of them still hang out with the other Germans, but they’re both upset with the whole situation.</li>
	<li>Sonja also skips class because she doesn’t like Claire (our teacher). </li>
	<li>There was someone accidentally put in our B2 class. “She was, like, A1. It was soooo bad. One time, Claire had her email open, and I saw she had sent an email about it labeled URGENT.” The girl was eventually moved to a different class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Earl is a fifty-something-year-old, heavyset, Filipino or Japanese-American guy. He’s in the C1 class and has been living in a penthouse in Montpellier for the last year. He used to work in finance and now is basically retired. He goes to a lot of the group events, and he drinks a lot. Today we went to a rooftop bar through an event organized by the school, and Earl was there. He dominates the conversation. I wonder if he realizes it. I try to start little side conversations with the other people there, especially the ones who are a bit quiet. To me, Earl is the stereotype of the middle-aged, single guy who moves abroad and lives lavishly. I’ll give him credit for committing to learning French and not just moving to the Philippines or Thailand like many other expats. </p>

<p>It’s the last day, and Hanna is the last person from my class I had a chance to chat with. She was smoking a cigarette outside the school, so I assumed she must have been pretty old. She’s 18, from the Czech Republic, and she just graduated from high school. She said she’s been smoking since she was 13 and that her “heavy smoking days” are behind her. She’s very well-dressed; she wore a completely different outfit to class every day this week. She wears sunglasses outside but doesn’t put them on, instead leaving them in her hair (“it’s just for the look”). She says everyone in the Czech Republic has no ambition, and she was that way too, but this summer she decided to be “less Czech” and booked language school for eight weeks. She took a 22-hour bus ride because she’s afraid of flying. She says she spends her time after class going to the beach, reading books in Czech, and drinking beer. What a European. </p>

<p>I went to Reflet d'Obione, a one-star Michelin restaurant, for dinner.</p>

<p><strong>June 29</strong></p>

<p>I left my homestay today. Lydia said my French has improved, and while I’m sure that’s true, it’s still so hard. She showed me pictures of her family. I asked about them, and she used the opportunity to scroll through her phone and show me her six kids and all her grandkids. None of them went to college. One owns a hair studio, another is the director of a local pool, another designs and makes leather goods, and one is a special-needs teacher, etc. Everyone lives a pretty normal, mundane French life. I showed her pictures of my family as well. She asked me about my dad, so I pulled up some old pictures I had saved online. She seemed a little sad, but mostly relieved that I was leaving. She’s been hosting for months straight, and I think she really looks forward to a break. She says hosting is extremely taxing for her, partially because she can’t spend the day in the nude as she’s used to.</p>

<p>Things we talked about in the last three weeks:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
	<li><b>Things aren’t as good as they used to be</b> - She’s mentioned at least five separate times how the government is screwing over the elderly ever since the pandemic. Everything is more expensive now than it used to be.</li>
	<li><b>World War 3</b> - She’s deathly afraid of it happening, for the sake of her kids.</li>
	<li><b>Her former host children</b> - She tells me about each one and where they’re from, and she compares them all the time.</li>
	<li><b>Singing range</b> - She was talking about how all the great singers had eight-octave vocal ranges; I felt obligated to explain to her that this was a misconception.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>June 30 / July 1</strong></p>
<p>I got to Lyon and immediately became very sick, probably because of the lingering stress from school and travel. After a long train ride, a cramped bus ride, and a labored walk up a tall hill in 95-degree heat, I finally checked into my hotel at 5:00 p.m. I spent nearly the next 24 hours in bed. My Oura Ring said I had a 102-degree fever. I did manage to make it out of my hotel around 7:00 p.m. the next day and walked around for two hours before grabbing dinner at a local <em>bouchon lyonnais</em> restaurant. I ordered a quenelle and nibbled on it for an hour. I must have looked so miserable because the staff kept coming by to check if I was okay. Lyon was nice; I will need to visit again when I’m not sick.</p>

<p><strong>July 2 - July 12</strong></p>
<p>I took a bus to Milan to meet my friend Jeff. Later, we met our friend Baxter in Nice. I’ll skip these days because it was mostly us doing vacation stuff. I feel like it’s not very interesting to write about the things we did. It was a lot of fun, but it’s normal vacation stuff. I guess this blog is really about my solo traveling, my language learning journey, and my thoughts on it. Ask me about this part of the trip later if you see me in real life.</p>

<p><strong>July 13</strong></p>
<p>In the evening, I dragged all my stuff from my hotel to the 15th arrondissement to meet my host family—or should I say host mother since it’s just one person. Her name is Véronique, and she’s 61 years old. I had sent her a written intro via email with my picture the week before to make our initial meeting go more smoothly. She was there to greet me when I got off the elevator on her floor. Her apartment is huge; I have my own bedroom and a private bathroom, and there’s another empty bedroom where her daughter used to live. I dropped my stuff in my room, and we went to chat in the living room. Véronique is a really excellent host mother. She’s so interested in chatting, getting me to speak, and correcting me when I make certain mistakes. She’s also very complimentary of my French, saying things like, “Your level is so impressive after just one year.” It actually came as a big surprise since I hadn’t been working on it for the last two weeks, and it’s hard to tell how much progress I’ve made since I arrived in France. Also, it’s clearly different when you’re with someone who has experience with students learning a new language. My host mother said she used to have American university students stay with her for three months at a time while they studied abroad for a semester, as well as other adult students who attend language school. They see how difficult it is to learn a language.</p>

<p><strong>July 14</strong></p>

<p>It’s Bastille Day in France, and there are lots of festivities tonight. At one point during the day, I brought Jeff to visit my apartment and my host mother since we had about an hour to kill before our dinner reservation. I basically chatted with Véronique in French the entire time (sorry, Jeff; I felt it would have been rude to speak English to you while we were in her home). I was feeling a bit sick and nauseous from eating so much rich food every day for the past two weeks, and I debated staying home, but Véronique insisted I go out and see the fireworks with Jeff and Baxter.</p>

<p>So I did.</p>
